Bavilum in Spain the father of Publius Licinius
Caecina, a man of praetorian rank, when an un-
bearable illness had made life hateful to him, and
so also several others. For this reason a great
controversy has arisen. Diagoras and Erasistratus
have utterly condemned it as a fatal drug, for-
hidding its use moreover in injections on the ground
that it is injurious to the eyesight. Andreas has
added that the only reason why it does not cause
instantaneous blindness is because it is adulterated
at Alexandria. Afterwards‚ however, its use was
not disapproved of in the form of the famous drug
called διὰ κωόυῶν (diacodion). The seed too pounded
into lozenges with milk is used to induce sleep, also
with rose oil for headache3 with rose oil too it is
poured into the ears for ear-ache. As a liniment for
gout it is applied with woman’s milk (the leaves by
themselves are also so used), likewise in vinegar for
erysipelas and wounds. I myself, however, should
disapprove of its addition to eye salves, and much
more to what are called febrifuges, digestives and
coeliacs; the dark poppy, however, is given in wine
for coeliae trouble. All kinds of cultivated poppy
are larger than the wild. The heads are round,
while those of the wild are long and small, though
for all purposes more effective. The poppy is boiled
and the liquid drunk for sleeplessness; with the
same water the face is fomented. The best poppies
grow on dry soils, and where the rainfall is slight.
When the heads themselves and the leaves are boiled
down, the juice is called meconium, and is much
weaker than opium. The chief test of opium is its

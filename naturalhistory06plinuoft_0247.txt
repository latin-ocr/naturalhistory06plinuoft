BOOK XXI. XLV. 77—78

XLV. There is another kind of honey, found in
the same district of Pontus among the people called
Sanni, which from the madness it produces is
called maenomenon.‘1 This poison is supposed to
be extracted from the flowers of the oleanders
which abound in the woods. Though these people
supply the Romans with wax by way of tribute, the
honey, because of its deadly nature, they do not sell.
In Persis, too, and in Gaetulia of Mauretania
Caesariensis, bordering on the Massaesyli, are found
poisoned honeycombs‚ sometimes only in part such,
a more deceptive limitation than anything else could
be, were it not that the livid colour makes detection
easy. What are we to think that Nature meant by
these traps; that they should not occur every year,
and not in the whole of the comh, and yet be due to
the same bees? Was it not enough to have pro-
duced a substance in which it was very easy to
administer poison? Did Nature also administer
it herself in the honey to so many living creatures?
What did she mean, except to make man more
eareful and less greedy? For had she not already
bestowed upon the bees themselves a spear, and
that a poisoned one, so that a eure for this poison
must be given most assuredly without delay?
Accordingly, it is healing to apply to the sting the
juice of the mallow or of 1vy leaves οι for the stung
persons to take these in d1·inl·. Y et it is wonderful
that the bees, carrying poison in their mouths and
working it, do not themselves die, unless it be
that the great Mistress of all things has given bees
this immunsty, as she has given immunity against
snake-bite to the Psylli and to the Marsi among
men.

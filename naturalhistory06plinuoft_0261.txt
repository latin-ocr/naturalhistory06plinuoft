chalceos‚ cnecos, polyacanthos‚ onopyxos, helxine,
scolymos. The chamaeleon has no prickles on its
leaves. There is however this difference also, that
some os these plants have many stems and branches,
the thistle for instance, while the cnecos has one
stem and no branches. Some are prickly only at
the head, the erynge for instance; some, like
tetralix and helxine, blossom in summer. Scolymos
too blossoms late and long. The acorna is distin-
guished (from cnecos)‘¹ only by its reddish colour
and richer juice. Atractylis too would be just the
same, were it not whiter and did it not shed a blood-
like juice that has caused some to call it phonos 3 ὸ
it also has a bad ⁰ smell, and its seed ripens late—in
fact not before autumn, though this can be said of
all prickly plants. All of these however can be
reproduced either from seed or from the root.
Scolymus, one of the thistle group‚ differs from
these in that its root is edible when boiled. It is a
strange thing that in this group,‘⁷l without inter-
mission throughout the whole sumnier,‘' part blos-
soms, part buds, and part produces seed. As the
leaves dry the prickles cease to sting.s Helxine is
not often seen, and not in all countries3 it shoots
out leaves from its root, out of the middle of which
swells up as it were an apple‚ covered with foliage of

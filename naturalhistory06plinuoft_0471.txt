quickly. That wine is less injurious to the sinewsa
that sweetens as it ages. Less beneficial to the
stomach is the wine that is rich and dark ⁶; it is,
however, more flesh-forming. A thin, dry wine is
less flesh-forming, but is more nourishing to the
stomaeh‚ and passes more rapidly by means of
urine, going, however, all the more to the head;
this remark may be taken once and for all to apply
to every other intoxicating liquor. Wine matured
by age and not by smoke is the most wholesome.
Wine-dealers first discovered the device, adopted
today also by householders as well, of adding age in
the storeroom to wines before they have acquired
cariosity naturally.⁶ By using the word “ cariosity ”
the rnen of old gave sound enough advice, since
smoke eats out cariosity even in timber, but we
moderns on the contrary are convinced that the
bitterness of smoke produces in wines the character
of age. VVines that are of 3 very pale colour become
unwholesome as they grow older. The more
generous a wine is the thicker it becomes with age,
contracting a bitter taste‚¹l which is very injurious to
health, and to spice 3 1633 mature wine with it is also
unwholesome. Each wine has its peculial· flavour,
the presence of which is 3 sign of great purity ε’;
each wine has an age—its middle age—when it is
most pleasant.

XXIII. Those who want to put on flesh or to relax
the bowels are benefited by drinking during meals;
those on the other hand who are reducing weight and

would mean that smoke was used to mellow wines than did not
ripen quickly enough by themselves.

⁴¹ Or, ‘⁴ condendug to a bitterness.”

⁰ Or, “ wholesomeness.''

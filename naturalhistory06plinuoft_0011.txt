PREFACE

Ι ΤΑΚΕ over the task of continuing the work of my
friend, the late Mr. H. Rackhani, with many fears
lest my effort prove an unworthy sequel.

A complete index of planis will be found at the end
of Volume VII. To identify each plant or tree as it
occurs would have involved many repetitions and
&oss-references, but a few identifications have been
inserted in 'the text and notes where they seemed

specially needed.

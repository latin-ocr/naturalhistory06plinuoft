use the blossom even of the thorn, while the young
stalks of the white thorn are preserved to be a
delieacy of the table. This is the suecession of
{lowers overseas. In Italy violets are followed by
the rose, which is still in blossom when the lily
appears. The rose is succeeded by the cyanus‚‘1 the
cyanus by the amaranth. But the vicapervica b is
an evergreen, surrounded by leaves at the joints
after the manner of the scarecrow cord,⁶ a plant for
the fancy gal-den, but at times filling the gap when
other flowers fail. This plant is called chamae-
daphne ἀ by the Greeks.

three years. After that time it degenerates. The
rose lasts even for five years if it is neither pruned
down nor burned; for by these means it renews its
youth. We have also said⁹ that the soil makes a
great difference. For in Egypt all theses flowers are
without perfume‚ and the myrtle only has a remark-
able one. In some places-0 the buds of all form as
much as two months before they do so elsewhere
Rose beds ought to be (lug over immediately after
the west windbh begins and aoain at the solstiee‚ and
great care should be taken that in the interval the
ground be kept clean and sweet.

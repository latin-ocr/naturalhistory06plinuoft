wounds, if applied with honey and not removed till the
seventh day3 also that beaten up in water it cures
scrofula and fistulas. Others moreover maintain that
it checks running sores, called nomae, removes too
excrescences, and smooths away scars; that if it is
chewed, or if cabbage water be used with honey as a
gargle‚ sores in the mouth or on the tonsils disappear,
as also do the itch and chronic leprous sores, if three
parts of it and two of alum in strong vinegar be
applied as a liniment. Epicharmus thought this
cabbage a sufficient remedy if applied to the bite of
a mad dog, and an even better one with the addition
of silphium juice and strong vinegar ; he also said that
dogs are killed by it, if given with their meat. Its
seed if roasted is a help against serpents, fungi, and
bull’s blood. The boiled leaves taken in food or
applied raw with sulphur and soda relieves splenic
diseases and also hardness of the breasts. The ash
of its roots even by a mere touch cures a swollen
uvula, reduces parotid swellings if applied with
honey, and heals bites of serpentS. Of the power of
cabbage I will add but one proof‚ which is both
striking and wonderful: let the scale form on the
inside of any vessel in which water is boiled‚ so that
it cannot be scraped away3 yet it disappears if
cabbage is boiled in them.

XXXVII. Among wild cabbages is also lapsana, Lapsana.
which is a foot high, has hairy leaves, being like
mustard, except that the flower is whiter. It is
eaten cooked, and soothes and relaxes the bowels.

XXXVIII. Of all the varieties, sea cabbage is seacabbaffl
the strongest purgative. On account of its pun-
gency it is cooked with fat meat, and is very bad
for the stomach.

ed by Chrysippus as injurious to stomach, urine and
ey esight, adding that it causes madness,letha1gusb

if covered hy a stone, breeds a scorpion, and that
ocimum chewed and left in the sun breeds wor1ns;

that the use of ocimum as a food breeds lice. The
period that followed saw strong defenders of ocimum,
who said that goats do eat it, that no man's mind
has been affected by it, and that in wine and a little

with rose oil or with myrtle oil or with vinegar, and
for eye fluxes if applied in wine. It is said too, to

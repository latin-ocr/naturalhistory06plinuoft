INTRODUCTION

Β.0., a famous herbalist (ῥιζοτόμος) mentioned by
both Pliny and Dioscorides. There is an interesting
(and genuine) fragment of Crateuas that can for-
tunately be compared with Dioscorides II. 176 and
Pliny XXI. ξ 164.α Several phrases in Crateuas are
exactly, or almost exactly, the same as the corre-
sponding phrases in Dioscorides, so that it is certain
that the latter made full use of the material collected
by the former. It may be that Pliny, too, read
Crateuas, but he is not as close to Crateuas as is
Dioscorides in the passage under consideration, so
that some hold that Pliny got most of his informa-
tion from one Sextius Niger, who, as Pliny tells
us, wrote in Greek. A yet earlier physician and
herbalist, Diocles of Carystos, may be the original
source of all the later writers on materia medica.
Speculation on such a point is useless, but our know-
ledge is sufficient to show that Pliny had access to
writings so similar to the work of Dioscorides that
the resemblances between the two authors can be
explained without supposing that Pliny was a
deceitful plagiarist.

for instance, they prescribed navew wine as beneficial
for fatigue after military exercises or riding, and to
pass over the others, they recommended even
juniper wine. And who would prefer to use worm-
wood wine rather than wormwood itself? Among
the rest let me omit also palm wine, which is

colic, and sciatica. In time of plaguen too, and on
travels, it is said to be a powcrful aid.

drunk with water it is a useful digestive to many
when they are convalescing, and a gargle of vinegar
and water is a good thing after sunstroke, the eyes too
being greatly benefited by fomentation with the
same mixture. It is a remedy after swallowing a
leech, as well as for leprous sores, scurf, running
sores, dog bites, the wounds of scorpions, of the
scolopendra and of the shrew-mouse; it is also an
antidote for the poison and irritation caused by all

BOOK XXI. L111. 90—L1V. 91

LIII. The Egyptians have besides many plants of
no repnte, but they hold in the highest esteem
one called cnecos3 it is unknown in Italy and the
Egyptians value it, not as a food, but for its oil,
which they extract from the seed. The chief
varieties are the wild and the cultivated. Of the
wild there are two species. One is similar to the
cultivated, but has a stiff‘l stem. This is why the
women of old used the stem of this species ὓ as a
distaffi for which reason it is called by some atractylis.
Its seed is white, large and bitter. The other is
rather prickly, with a more fleshy stem, which Prz'clcly
almost trails on the ground, the seed being very ''²⁰⁸³-
small. This belongs to the class of spinous plants,
for I must classify also the various kinds of them.

LIV. Some plants then are prickly,⁶ while others
are without prickles. Of prickly plants the species
are many. Of nothing but prickle are asparagus
and scorpio, for they have no leaves at all. Some
prickly plants, however, have leaves, for instance
thistle‚ erynge, glycyrrhiza⁰l and nettle. For all
these have a sharp sting in their leaves. Some have
foliage also along ⁶² the prickly spine, as caltrop and
rest-harrow. Some again have prickles not on the
leaves but on the stem, as pheos, that some have

⁶ Hort translates ἀκανθικός, ἄκανθαι, in the closely parallel
passage of Theophrastus (VI. l, 2> by ‘⁶ spinous‚’' “ spines.''
It is scarcely possible to use these words in translating Pliny,
for he includes the nettle.

'¹ “ Sweet root‚'' our liquorice. But there is an error here.
See XXII. 24, and index of plants in Vol. VII.

⁴³ Theophrastus has (VI. Ῑ, 3) τὰ δὲ καὶ παρὰ πὴν ἄκανθαν
ἕτερον ἔχει φύλλονι “Others again have leaves as well as
their spines‘' (Hort). Apparently Pliny took παρὰ to be
‘⁴ along.’'

INTRODUCTION

fication of ancient descriptions of disease, meets
us again when we come to complaints of the eyes.
These were very common, because dust was
everywhere, and hygienic rules for keeping it
uncontaminated were unknown. Moreover,
there were no mechanica] aids, such as spec·
tacles. Pliny mentions aegilops, albugo, argema,
caligO, epinyctis, epzphora, glaucoma, thspoclzysis,
inflammatio, lippztudo, nubeculae, nyctalops, pra-
rzgo, pterygiam, scabritia, sufficsio, as well as other
dis01··,de1s nervous or functional. Some of these
names, laying stress on a prominent symptom,
which is common to more than one eye trouble,
cannot be safely assigned to any particular
modern dise-ase. but a few identifications are
fairly certain.

Aegilops.—-This was a lacrimal fistula, at the angle
near the nose.

Albugo.——Occurring only in Pliny, meant a white
ulcer3 it is uncertain of what kind. Albugines
could occur on the head (XXVI. §160).

Argema. —A small white ulcer, partly on the cor nea
partly on the sclerotic coat of the eye.

Calzgo. —Any dimness, pa1··ticula1ly that caused by
ophthalmia.

Epinyctis.—A sore on the eyelid. See p. viii.

Epiphora.——Any flux from the eye.

Glaucoma.-An opaqueness of the crystalline lens.

Hypochysis.—Cataract.

Lippituclo.—Ophthalmia, inflammation of the eye.

Nubecula.-A cloudy film over the eye, perhaps
sometimes a form of cataract.

Nyctalops.—One who is afflicted with night
blindness.

juice extracted from the skin of the root‚‘¹ and
drunk in wine or diluted vinegar, counteracts the
poison of scorpions. There must also be given a
recipe of the ancients. The juice of the ripe fruit
was mixed with that of the unripe, and the two
boiled in a copper vessel to the consistency of honey.
Some used to add myrrh and cypress and then to
bake the mixture very hard in the sun, stirring it
three times a day with a spatula. This was their
stomatice‚¹' which they also used to help the
formation of a sear on wounds. Another method
was to squeeze the juice from dried fruit3 this
greatly improved the flavour of viands, and was
moreover used in medicine for corroding sores,
phlegm on the chest, and whenever astringent
treatment of the bowels was called for. It was also
used to rinse the teeth. A third kind ofjuice is to
make a decoctior] of the leaves and root, to be
applied in oil to burns. The leaves are also applied
by themselves. An incision into the root at the
time of harvest yields a juice admirably suited to
relieve toothache‚ gatherings and suppurations,
besides acting as a purge. Mulberry leaves soaked
in urine remove hair from hides.

LXXII. Cher-ries relax the bowels‚ but are ementes.
injurious to the stomach; dried cherries arrest
looseness of the bowels and are diuretic. I find it
stated in my authorities that if anyone swallows
cherries with their stones in the morning, when the
dew is on them. the bowels are so relieved that the
feet are freed from gout.

LXXIII. Medlars, except the setanian,⁶ which is Medlars.
nearer to the apple in its properties‚ act astringently
upon the stomach and check looseness of the bowels.

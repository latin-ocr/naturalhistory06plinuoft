XXVIII. As foliage for chaplets smilax', ivy and
their clusters provide the favourite material; about
these I have spoken at length in my chapters on
shrubsfl There are other kinds also that can be
indicated only by their Greek names, because our
countrymen for the most part have paid no attention
to this nomenclature. Though most of them grow
in foreign lands, yet I must discuss them, because
my subject is not Italy but Nature.

XXIX. So among the leaves used to make chaplets
are found those of melotrum, spiraea, wild mar-
joram, cneorum, that Hyginus calls cassia, conyza,
which he calls cunilago, melissophyllum, known to
us as apiastrum, and melilot, which we call Cam-
panian garland. For in Italy the favourite kind
grows in Campania, in Greece at Sunium, next in
repute the melilot of Chalcidice and Crete being
found however everywhere only in wild, woody
districts. That chaplets were in antiquity often
made from the melilot is shown by the name
sertula (garland)‚ which it has adopted as its own.
The seent is near to that of saffmu, and so is the
flower itself. The Campanian ὸ is very popular
indeed, having very short and very fleshy leaves.

XXX. The leaves of trefoil also are used for chap-
lets. There are three kinds of it: the first is called
by some Greeks minyanthes, by others asphaltion‚
having a larger leaf than the other kinds, which the
gai-land makers use. The second kind, oxytri-
phyllon, has a pointed leaf. The third is the smallest
of them all. Among these some have a sinewy stem,
such as mamthum, hippomarathum, myophonum.
They use also fennelgiant, the clustcrs of the ivy
and a red flower classified in another kind of the

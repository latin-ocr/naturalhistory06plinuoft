BOOK XXII. XLIII. 87—XL1v. 90

shrillest, women are most amorous and men most
backward in sexual unions, as though it were through
Nature's providence that this stimulant is at its best
when badly needed. Offensive odour from the arm-
pits is corrected by an ounce of the root, without
the pith, in three heminae of Falerniau wine boiled
down to one third, to be taken fasting after the bath
and again after food, the dose being a cyathus at a
time. Xenocrates assures us of a remarkable thing,
that he has proved by experiment‚ that the offensive
smell passes off from the armpits by way of the urine.

XLIV. Sow-thistle too is edible—at any rate
Callimachus makes Hecale‘1 set it before Theseus
-both the pale kind and the dark. Both are like
lettuce, except that they are prickly, with a stem a
cubit high, angular and hollow inside, which on being
broken streams with a milky juice. The pale kind,
which shines because of the milk in it, is good for
asthma if taken with salad—dressing as is lettuce.
Erasistratus informs us that it carries away stone
in the urine, and that to chew it purifies foul breath.
Three cyathi of the juice warmed in white wine
and oil aid delivery, but the expectant mother must
take a walk immediately after drinking it3 it is also
given in broth. A decoction of the stem itself makes
the milk abundant in nurses and improves the com-
plexion of the babies‚ being very useful to those
women who are subject to curdling their milk. The
juice is injected into the ears, and a cyathus of it is
drunk warni for strangury, for gnawing pains of the
stomach with cucumber seed and pine kernels. It is
used also externally for abscesses at the anus. It
is taken in drink for the poison of snakes and scor-
pions‚ but the root is used as an externa] application.

greasc for scrofulous sores. For tertian agnes the
Magi recommend us to gathcr it with the left hand
without looking back, while saying for whose sake
it is being gathered; then a leaf of it should be
placed under the tongue of the patient to be swal-
lowed presently in a cyathus of water.

CV. Trychnos‚ spelt by some strychnos, I wish
the Egyptian florists did not use for their chaplets:
they are tempted to (lo so by the resemblance of the
leaves of both kinds to those of ivy. One of these
kinds, bearing in a seed-bag scarlet berries with a
stone in them, is called haheacabos, by others callion,
and by our eountrymen bladder-wort‚ because of its
usefulness in cases of stone and other complaints of
the bladder. It is a woody shrub rather than a
plant, with large, broad, conical seed—bags, with a
large stone inside, which ripens in November. A
third kind has the. leaves of basil, and should receive
the briefest of descriptions from one who is dealing
with remedies⁷ not poisons, for a very small amount
of the juice causes madness. Yet the Greek writers
have actually made a jest of this property. For
they have said that a dose of one drachma plays
tricks with the sense of shame‚<2 speaking of hallu-
cinations ὸ and realistic visions3 that a double dosc
causes downright insanity3 any addition moreover
to the dose bringing instant death. This is the
poison which in their innocence very unsophisticated
writers have called dorycnion ⁰ because spe-ars before
battle had their points dipped in it, as it grows
everywhere. Those who censured it less severely
gave it the name manicomd those who from evil
motives tried to keep its nature secret called it

⁰ From δόρυ z spear. ‘¹ I.e.‚ maddening.

next best test is to put it in a lamp, when it should
burn with a bright, clear flanoe, and smell only when
it has gone out3 adulterated opium does not behave
in this fashion. Adulterated opium is also harder
to light, and is continually going out. A further
test of pure opium is by water, on which it floats as
a light cloud, while the impure gathers into blisters.
But especially wonderful is the fact that pure opium is
detected by the summer sun. For pure opium sweats
and melts until it becomes like freshly gathered juice.
Mnesides thinks that opium is best kept by adding
the seed of henbane, others by putting it in beans.

LXXVII. Intermediate between the cultivated
poppy and the wild is a third kind, for though growing
on cultivated land it is self-sown3 we have called it
rhoeas or roving poppy.a Some gather it and eat it
straight away with the whole calyx. It acts as a
purge3 five heads boiled in three heminae of wine
also induce sleep.

LXXVIII. Of the wild poppy one kind is called
ceratitis. Black-seeded, a cubit high, with a thick
root covered with a hard skin‚ it has a little calyx
curved like a little horn. Its leaves ὓ are smaller and
thinner than those of the other wild varieties. The
seed is small, ripening at harvest3 half an acetabulum
of it, taken in honey wine, acts as a purge. The
pounded leaves with oil cure eye-ulcers of beasts of
burden. Its root, in the proportion of one acetabulum
to two sextarii of water, boiled down to one half, is
given for complaints of the loins and liver. Its leaves
applied in honey are a cure for carbuncles. This
variety is called glaucionc by some and paralium d
by others, for it grows within reach of the sea breezes
or in alkaline soils.

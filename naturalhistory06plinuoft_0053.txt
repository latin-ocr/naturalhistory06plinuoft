scorpions when taken in wine or vinegar and water.
Its root used as a dentifrice is a cure for tooth—
ache.

XVI. In Syria very great pains are taken over
kitchen-gardens ; hence the Greek proverb: “ Syrians
have plenty of vegetables.” They sow a vegetable
called by some gingidion that is very like staphylinus‚
only it is slighter and more bitter, though its pro-
perties are the same. It is caten, cooked or raw,
with great advantage to the stomach, for it dries up
all its humours, however deep these may lie.

XVII. Wild (or stray) parsnip is like the culti-
vated kind and has similar properties. It stimulates
the appetite, banishing distaste for food, if taken in
vinegar and silphi11m‚a or with pcpper and honey wine,
or if you like with fish sance. It is both diuretic, as
Ophion believes, and an aphrodisiac. Diocles too is
of the same opinion, and moreover thinks that it acts
as a cordial in convalescence‚ or is very useful after
many vomitings. Heraclides prescribed it for mer-
cury poisoning, for occasional impotence and in
convalescence. Hicesius said that the reason why
it appeared to be harmful to the stomach was that
no one could eat three skirrets iu successi0n3 adding
however that it was beneficial to convalescents who
are beginning to take wine again. The juice,
especially of the cultivated variet-y, checks looseness
of the bowels if drunk with goats' milk.

XVIII. Since most people confuse the two similar
Greek names, σίσαρον and σέσελι (σίλι), we have
added some account of sili or hartwmt, though it is a
plant generally known. The best is that of Massilia,
for its seed is broad and yellow: the next best,
the Aethiopiam, is darker, and the Cretan has the

INTRODU CTION

Prurigo.——Chronic itching of the eye.

Pterygium.—Also called unguis, an inflammatory
swelling at the inner angle of the lower lid. Also

It will be seen that often a Latin name can be
associated only with a symptom or symptoms.
Moreover, Pliny's nomenclature does not altogether
coincide with that of Celsus, so that the invaluable
aid of the latter is not always available.

Abscesses are called by various names, such as
carbunculus, collectio, furunculus, panus, paratis, tumor.
The paratis received its name from its position by
the ear, the panus was a superficial abscess in a hair
follicle (Spencer on Celsus V. 18, 19), and the others
probably denoted variations in size or severity.

There is much confusion in the use of Latin terms
to denote conditions due to mortification and putre—
faction of the tissues. We have the terms cancer,
carcinoma, erysipelas, ignis sacer, phagedaena, and
Pliny’s favourite word ulcera, very often qualified
by an adjective οι· participle like cetera, manantia,
putrescentia, serpentia. On the other hand there
are the modern terms sepsis, erysipelas, lupus,
shingles, gangrene, cancer. Identifications are often
difficult, or even impossible, and the medical his-
torian, faced with the Latin names, can do little
more than make probable guesses.

Pliny does not use the word erysipelas, but ignis
sacer, and this may sometimes refer to lupus or to
shingles (XXVI. §121). Pkagedaena is certainly
gangrene, and so perhaps are ulcera serpentia or
putrescentia. Super-ficia] malignant disease would

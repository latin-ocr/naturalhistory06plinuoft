are not, so far as can be seen, beneficial to the
stomach. They relievea a cough and are ssesh-
forming food. The juiee of boiled dates used to be
given by the ancients to invalids instead of hydromel
to restore their strength and to assuage thirst; for
this purpose they used to prefer Thebaic dates, which
are also useful‚ especially in food, for the spitting
of blood. The dates called caryotae are applied with
quinees, wax, and saffron to the stomach, bladder‚
belly and intestines. They heal bruises. The
kernels of dates, if they are burnt in a new earthen
vessel and the ashes washed, take 'che place of
spodium, are an ingredient of eye-salves, and with
the addition of nard make lotions sor the eyebrows.

LII. The palm which bears Ρ) the myrobalanum,
found in Egypt, is very highly esteemed.c It has
no stone in its dates, as other date-palms have.
Taken in a dry wine it checks diarrhoea and
excessive menstruation, and unites woundsst

LIII. The palm called elate or spathe gives to
medicine its buds, leaves, and bark. Its leaves are

περικάλυμμά ἐστι τοῦ καρποῦ τῶν φοινίκων ἀκμὴν ἀνθούντων.
Pliny on the other hand speaks of “ the palm which bears the
myrobalanum‚'' giving it (or its fruit) the properties attributed
by Dioscorides to ‘che Egyptian date. He goes on to say that
the spathe was a palm with medicina] properties in its sprigs,
leaves and bark.

Among Pliny’s mistakes seems to be the confusion of ben
nub (myrobalanum) with what is called by Dioscorides
φοινικοβάλανος. Cf. Pliny XII. § 103. The conjecture of
Hardouin (refert) clears away one discrepancy between
Dioscorides and Pliny if we take palma in the first sentence of
ξ 98 to mean “ date‚'' but then the words in balanis become
oddly otiose. No emendation, however, can make spathe in
ξ 99 mean anything but a tree3 it certainly cannot mean the
περικάλυμμα τοῦ καρποῦ Of Dioscorides.

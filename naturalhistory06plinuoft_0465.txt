BOOK XXIII. xvm. 29—X1x. 32

It causes headache, and is injurious to the throat,
but good for kidneys, liver, intestines and bladder,
for it makes these organs smooth. It is particularly
efficacious against the buprestiS,‘¹ opium, curdled
milk, hemlock, poisons and dorycnium ²’; it should
be taken in οἱ] and brought up again by vomitings.
For all purposes white must is the weaker; raisin
must is more pleasant, besides causing less headache.

XIX. The varieties of wine, their very many
differences, and most of the properties of each I have
already described.c There is no topic more difficolt
to handle, or more full of detail, seeing that it is hard
to say whether wine does good to more people or
harms them. Resides, a draught is fraught with great
risk, it being uncertain whether it will immediately
turn out to be a help or a poison. And indeed I shall
confine my present remarks to the properties of wine
as a medicine. Asclepiades composed one volume
on its administration, a circumstance which gave
him a nickname ‘²3 but his commentators on it
afterwards composed an endless number of them. I,
with Roman seriousness and with my appetite for the
liberal arts, will carefully discuss the separate detailsf
not as a physician, but to point out their effect on
human health. But to treat of the various kinds of
wine one by one is a vast and baffling task, because
medical opinion is very divided.

XXIV. 31. This is strong evidence in favour of cognominatus.
The plural coynominatis seems to be an emendation of one who
did not see that innumera, is governed, not by dissent-ere, but
by condidere understood from condidit.

⁶ Ista distinqnemus. The connection of thought, seems to
be: “ Ι hope to keep these details distinct, and to discuss
wines seriously (though not as a physician), because their
making and use is a fine art.¹'

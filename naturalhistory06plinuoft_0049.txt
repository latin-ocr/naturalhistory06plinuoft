intestinal worms3 a decoction of them boiled down
to one third, drunk with wine, is good for intestinal
hernia; so taken they draw off superfluousa blood.
For these purposes and for spitting of blood Medius
prescribes that they should be given cooked, as well
as to women lying-in to increase the supply of milk;
Hippocrates that radishes should be rubbed on the
head of women when the hair falls off, and that they
should be placed on the navel for pains in the womb.
They also bring scars back to the original colour of
the skin. An application also of the seed soaked in
water arrests ulcers called pliagedaeiiae.⁶ Demo-
critus thinks that as a food radislies are aphrodisiac3
for this reason, perhaps, some have maintained that
they are injurious to the voice. The leaves, but only
those of the long radish, are said to improve the eye-
sight; should however too strong a dose of radish be
applied as a remedy, they prescribe the immediate
use of hyssop, for it is antipathetiC. For deafness
the juice of the radish is dropped into the ear. But,⁶
for those who would vomit, it is very useful to eat

radishes after a meal.

call the wild mallow, and others πλειστολοχεία,;ά
it is a cure for ulcers and for broken cartilages and
bones. The leaves, taken in water, relax the
bowels; they keep serpents away, and used as a
liniment heal the stings of bees, wasps and hornets.
Its root dug up before sun-rise is wrapped in wool of
the colour called ‘⁴ natural,’' taken moi-eover from
a ewe that has given birth to a ewe lamb, and bound
on scrofulous sores, even when they have suppurated.
Some think that when it is to be used for this purpose
the root should be dug up with a tool of gold, care

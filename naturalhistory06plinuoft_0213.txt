the caltha being strong.‘² No less strong is the scent
of the plant which they call royal broom‚ though it

is not the flowers that smell, but the leaves.¹'
XVI. Baccar too, which is called by some field Baccar.

nard, has scent in the root only. That unguents used
to be made by the ancients from this root we have a
witness in Aristophanes, a poet of the Old Comedy.
Whence some used to commit the error of calling it
by a Greek name, baccaris.⁶ The scent is very
like that of cinnamon. It grows on a thin dry soil.
Very like it is the plant called combretum,d taller
than the baccar, and with leaves so thin that they
are mere threads. These are only used as unguents.⁶²
But the mistake of those also must be corrected who
have called baccar field nard. For there is another
plant with this surname, which the Greeks call
asaron, whose shape and appearance we have de-
scribed among the varieties of nard! Moreover, I
find that the plant is styled asaron, because it is not
used in the making of chaplets.

XVII. Wild saffron is better than any other. To Saffron.
grow it in Italy is most unprofltable‚ as a whole
bed of saffron yields only a scruple of the essence.
It is propagated from a bulb of the root. The culti-
vated saffron is broader, larger and more handsome,
but much less potent; it is degenerating everywhere,
and is not prolific even at Cyrene, where grows a
saffron whose flowers have always been very famous.

Plimlelsayhoff's haec sutilia tantum would mean: “these are
only sewed on ohaplets.“ The fragile leaves might otherwise

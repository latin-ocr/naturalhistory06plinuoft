way. Three sextarii of the juice from the fruit are
reduced by a gentle heat to the consistency of
honey3 then are added two denarii of dried
omphaciunn or one of myrrh, and one denarius of
saffron. These are beaten up together and mixed

There are besides marvels related of the mulberry.
When it begins to bud, but before the leaves unfold‚
the fruit-to-be is plucked with the left hand. The
Greeks call them 1·icini.²³ These, if they have not
touched the ground, when worn as an amulet stay
a flow of blood, whether it flows fron] a wound, the
mouth, the nostrils, or from haemorrhoids. For this
purpose they are stored away and kept. The same
effect is said to be produced if there be broken off
at a full moon a branch beginning to bear3 it must
not touch the ground, and is specially useful when
tied on the upper arm of a woman to prevent
excessive menstruation. It is thought that the
sanie result is obtained if the woman herself breaks
off a branch at any time, provided that it does not
touch the ground before it is used as an amulet.
Mulberry leaves pounded, or a decoction of dried
leaves, are used as an application for snake bite, and
it is of some ⁶ benefit to take them in drink. The

⁶ Or, with the reading of Mayhoff, “equally beneficial.‘’

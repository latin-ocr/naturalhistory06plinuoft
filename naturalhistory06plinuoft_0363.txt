XXVIII. We have also the lotometra? a plant
derived from the lotus. From its rotted seed,
which is like millet, are made by the shepherds in
Egypt loaves that they knead mostly with water or
milk. It is said that no bread is more healthful or
lighter than this, so long as it is warni, but when
cold it becomes heavy and difficult of digestion. It
is an established fact that those who live on it are
never attacked by dysentery, tenesmus, or any other
disease of the bowels. Accordingly it is considered
to be one of the remedies for such ailments.

XXIX. I have spoken more than once ⁶ of the
marvel of heliotropium, which turns round with the
sun even on a cloudy day, so great a love it has for
that luminary. At night it closes its blue flower
as though it mourned.⁶ There are two varieties—
tricoccum and helioscopium. The latter is the tanet,
although neither is more than half a foot in height,
and sends out branc-hes from a single‘l root. Its
seed, enclosed in a pod, is gathered at harvest time.
It grows nowhere but in a rich, well cultivated soil,
but tricoccum grows everywhere. I find it said
that, boiled, it is an agreeable sauce, that in milk it
is a gentle laxative‚ and that a draught of the decoc-
tion is a most drastic purge. The juice of the taller
plant is collected in summer at the sixth hour; it is
mixed with wine, which makes it keep longer.

accepted by Detlefsen and Mayhoff, is doubtful, but a more
convincing correction of the impossible porri of the MSS. has
yet to be made.

Pliny seems to have gone wrong in several details, or to be
mixing up two plante.

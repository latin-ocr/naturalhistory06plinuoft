BOOK XXII. xxm. 66—xn'11. 69

XXXI. Pieris a is so called because ofits remarkable
bitterness, as I have already stated,¹> and has a
round leaf. It is excellent for the removal of warts.
Thesium too is of a like bitterness, but is a strong
purgative, for which use it is pounded in water.

XXXII. Asphodel is one of the most famous
plants, so that some have styled it the plant of the
herocs3 Hesiod said that it also grows in woods, Dio-
nysius that it may be male or female. It is agreed
that its bulbs boiled down with barley water are very
suitable for wastingffbodies and consumptives, and
that kneaded with meal they make a very whole-
some bread. Nicander ⁶ too prescribcd for the poison
of snakes and scorpions either the stalk which I have
called (Ι anthericum, or the seed, or the bulbs, the
dose being three drachmae taken in wine, and he
would have them spread under the sleeping place,
should there be any sear of venomous creatures. It
is also prescribed for poisoning by sea creatures and
by land scolopendras. It is strange how in Cam-
pania the snails seek its stalk and by sucking shrivel
it up. The leaves too in wine are applied to the
wounds of venomous creatur-es. The bulbs are
pounded and applied with pearl barley to the sinews
and jointS. It is a good plan to chop them up and
to rub lichene with them in vinegar3 also to put
them in water on putrescent sores, and on inflam-
mations too of the breasts and testicles. Boiled
down in lees of wine and dabbed on from below with
a piece of lint, they cure fluxes of the eyes. In
nearly every disease the bulbs are usually boiled
before use, but for foul sores on the shins, and for
cracks in any part of the body they are dricd and
reduced to powder. Autunm is the time they are

be included under carcinoma, but neither Celsus nor
Pliny says anything about internal cancer, though
this was known to Hippocrates (Aplzorisms VI. 38).

Podagra presents a problem to the translator.
‘⁴ Gout ” is really too nari-ow an equivalent, for
podagra and chiragra were used of any pain in the
joints of the feet and hands. Usually, however, our
gout is meant, unless Dr. Spencer is right when he
says (Celsus I. 464) that chronic lead poisonfflg, which
presents the symptoms of gout, may have been
common at Rome owing to the extensive use of lead
water-pipes.

Two ternis are very troublesonie to the translator
-opistlzotonus·and orthopnoea, and a third, angina.
is almost equally so. The diseases concerned are
discussed by Celsus in IV. 6, l, IV. 8, l and IV. 7, 1.
These are translated by Dr. W. Gr. Spencer as
follows 2-—

(a) ‘⁴ There is, however. no disease more distress-
ing, and more acute, than that which by a sort of
rigor of the sinews, now draws down the head to the
shoulder—blades‚ now the chin to the chest, now
stretches out the neck straight and immobile. The
Greeks call the first opisthotonus, the next empros*
thotonus‚ and the last tetanus, although some with
less exactitude use these terms indiscriminately.’'—-
IV. 6, l.

(b) “There is also in the region of the throat a
malady which amongst the Greeks has different
names according to its intensity. It consists alto—
gether in a difficulty of breathing3 when moderate
and without any choking‚ it is called dyspnoe33
when more severe, so that the patient cannot breathe

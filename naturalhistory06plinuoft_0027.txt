feel with regat-d to the arts of the Magi. He speaks
of their vanitas and ιἶνιηιάεε, but nevertheless gives
details of their prescriptions and amine-ts, over sixty

and medicines. Perhaps the most interesting
example of this uncertain attitude occurs in XXVIII.
ἓ 85. z'd quoque convenit, quo nihil equidem libentius
crediderim, tactis omnino menstruo postibus inritas fieri
Illagorum artes, generis vanissimi. Pliny would ‘¹ like
to believe ’⁷ that by merely smearing the door—posts
the arts of the Magi, “ those arrant quacks,'’ would
be “made of no effect.” The Magi were a genus
vanissimum, and yet it would be a good thing to
render their artes harmless! An ars which is not
inrita, but must be made so, can scarcely be vanissima.
In several other passages Pliny expresses his strong
disapproval of Magism‚ which he thus dislikes‚
distrusts‚ and yet fears.

BOOK XXI. xcw. 165-166

The flower never opens except when the wind is
blowing, a fact to which it owes its na1ne.⁰ The
wild anemone is the larger, and its leaves are broader‚⁰
the flower being scarlet. Many have been misled
into identifying the wild anemone with the arge-
mone, others again with the poppy that Ι have called
rhoeas.⁶ But there is a great difference between
them, because these two blossom after the anemone,
which does not yield a juice like theirs, has not their
calyx‚d and there is no likeness except the head like
asparagus. Anemones are good for headache and
inflammations, for uterine complaints and for lacteal
troubles.‘ They also promote menstruation when
taken with barley water or used on a wool pessary.
The root chewed brings away phlegm, is healing to
the teeth‚s and when boiled down to fluxes of the
eyes and to scars. The Magi have attributed to the
anemones a kind of mystic potency‚ recommending
that the plant which is first seen should be taken up
in that year with the utterance that it is being
gathered as a remedy for tertian and quartan agues;
after this the blossoms must be wrapped up in 9 a
red rag and kept in the shade, and so be used, should
occasion arise, as an amulet. If the crushed root of
the anemone bearing a scarlet flower be applied to
the skin of any living creature, it produces a sore by
reason of its astringent quahties, and for this reason
it is employed for cleansing ulcerous sores.

are therefore attractive‚ especially as lacte accusative would
naturally be changed to lacti by an ignorant scribe, and with
the received punctuation quoque comes in with a jerk. The
sense however is much the same either way.

s Possibly, “ cures toothache.’'

θ Or, “bound together with,’' unless we read, as Mayhoff
suggests», liqari.

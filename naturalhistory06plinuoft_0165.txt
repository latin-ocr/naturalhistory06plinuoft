abscesses and inflammation of the breasts, and an
application of the leaves, boiled down in wine,
removes superficial abscess.‘² The same leaves dried
and boiled down in milk cure very quickly the most
racking cough. Hippocrates gave the juice of the
boiled—down root to be drunk by wounded men who
were thirsty through loss of blood, and applied the
plant itself with honey and resin to wounds ; likewise
to 111111505, sprains, and swelling83 as above also to
1111150105, sinews and joints. He gave it to be taken
in wine by patients suffering from cramp or dysen-
tery. It is remarkable that water to which this
root has been added thickens in the open air and
congeal& The fresher it is also, the better.
LXXXV. Sorrcl (lapathum) has similar properties.
There 15 also a wild kind called by some oxalis, by
our people rumex and by others gelding 501101. It
has a taste very like that of the cultivated kind,
pointed leaves, the colour of white beet and a very
small root, being when mixed with axle-grease very
efficacious for Scrofula. There 15 also another kind,
generally called pointed 501101, even more like the
cultivated kind, but with a leaf more pointed and
redden growing only in marshy localities. There
are some who speak of a water 501101, growing in
water, and yet another, horse sorrel, larger‚ paler
and more compact than the cultivated kind. The
wild 5011015 heal the stings of scorpions and protect
from stings those who carry them on their persons.
The root, boiled down in vinegar, 15 good for the
teeth‚ if the juice be used as a mouth wash, while to
drink the same 15 good for jaundice. The seed cures
inveterate stomach troubles. The root of horse
sorrel, in particular, brings away scabrous nailS; its

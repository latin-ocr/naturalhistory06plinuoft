BOOK XXII. xlm. 92—94

XLVI. Among the things which it is rasha to eat
I would include mushrooms, as although they make
choice eating they have been brought into disrepute
by a glaring instance of murder, being the means
used to poison the Emperor Tiberius Claudius by
his wife Agrippina, in doing which she bestowed upon
the world, and upon herselfin particular, yet another
poison—her own son Nero. Some of the poisonous
mushrooms are easily recognized by their being of a
pale—red colour, of a putrid appearance and of a
leaden hue inside; the furrows of the striated parts
are mere chinks,⁰ with a pale rim all round the edge.
Not all the poisonous kinds are like this, and there
is a dry sort, similar to the genuine mushroom,
which shows as it were white drops on the top,
standing out of its outer coat. The earth in fact
produces first a matrix for this purpose, and aster-
wards the mushroom itself in the matrix, like the
yoke inside the egg3 and the baby mushroom is
just as fond of eating its coat as is the chick. The
coat cracks when the mushroom first forms 3 presently,
as the mushroom gets bigger, the coat is absorbed
into the body of the foot—stalk, two heads rarely ever
springing from one foot. The first origin and cause
of mushrooms is the slime and the souring juice of
the damp ground, or often ofthe root of acorn-bearing
trees,⁶ and at first is flimsier than froth‚ then it grows
substantial like parchment, and then the mushroom,
as I have said, is born. How chancy a matter it is to
test these deadly plants! ἀ If a boot nail, a piece of

loss of -ferae, or it should perhaps be deleted as being due to

dittography. See XVI. §33.

different people—there are to test these deadly plants !'’

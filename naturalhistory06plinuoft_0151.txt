LXXIX. A second variety of wild poppy is called
heraclium, by others aphron, having leaves, if you
look at it from a distance, that look like spar1·ows.“
Its roots are on the surface of the ground, and its seed
is like foam. It is from the use of this plant that linen
gets its shiny whiteness. In summer it is pounded
in a mortar for epilepsy, the dose being an aceta-
bulum in white wine3 ὸ for it causes vomiting‚ and
is very useful foi the drng called diacodion and
arteriace. This preparation houmer is made by
steeping one hundred and twenty heads of this or
any other wild poppy in three sextarii of rain water
for two days; then they are thoronghly boiled in
the same water, and after the wl101e⁶has been
dried it is again boiled down to one half with honey
in a slow heat. More recently there has been
added six drachmae of saffron, hypocisthis, frankin-
cense and gum acacia, with a sextarius of Cretan
raisin-wine. This however 13 just for show; this
simple and old-fashioned remedy depends for its
virtues entirely on the poppy and honey.

LXXX. A third variety is tithymalon, called by
some mecon, by others paralion, with a leaf like that
of flax, a white flower, and a head of the size of a
bean. Itis &athered when the grape is at its best ά
and then dried' 1n the shade. Its seed taken 1n half an
acetabulum of honey wine, pursres the bow 613. But
the head of any poppy, whether fresh or dried, if
applied to the eyes relieves fluxes. Opium taken
in nearly neat wine, if administered immediately, is

⁰ Mayhoff's addition of suco is attractive.
ἆ Or: “when the grape-bunch is in flower.’‘ Pliny XI.§ 34
says that uva floret at the solstice.

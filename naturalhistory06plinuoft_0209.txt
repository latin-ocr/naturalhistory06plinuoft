springs up among shrubs. without perfume and
without the yellow anthei-s in the centre, it resembles
the lily only in colour, being as it were a first attempt
by Nature when she was learning to produce lilies.
White 111165 are propagated by all 1116 means that
roses are;0¹ more than this, by a peculiar tear-like
gum of its own, as 15 also horse-parsley. No plant is
111016 prolific, a single root often sending out fifty
bulbs. There is also a red lily that the Greeks call
61111011,ὸ 501116 calling its 1110550111 1116 dog—rose.C The
most esteemed kind grows at Antioch and at Lao-
dicea in Syria, next to thern 6011165 that of Phaselis.
The fourth place 15 held by the kind growing in Italy.

XII. There is also a bright-red lily,d having some-
times a double stem, and differing from other 111165
only in having a fleshier root and a larger bulb, and
that undivided. It is called the narcissus. Another
variety of it has a white flower and a reddish
bud. There is this further difference between the
ordinary lily and the narcissus, that the leaves of
the latter grow straight out of the root. The most
popular sort is found on the mountains of Lycia.
A third kind has all its characteristics the same as
those of the other kinds, except that the cup θ 15
light green. All the narcissi blossom late, for the
flower comes after the rising of Arcturus s and during
the autumna] equinox.

XIII. In lily-culture a strange means of dyeing
the blooms has been invented by the wit of man.
For in the month of July drying stems of the lily

⁶ It seems doubtful whether Pliny means here by calix the
calyx or the corolla. If the former, the lightness of the
green is the point of the sentence.

s Arcturus has its rising according to Pliny (II. 5124)
eleven days before the autumnal equinox.

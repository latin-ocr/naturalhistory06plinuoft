cough ; they are good, however, for those who intend
to vomit fasting, for tenesmos and for colio, as they
bring away phlegm.‘² Taken in time these nuts
deaden the effeets of poisons, neutralize onions and
make their flavour milder. They are applied to
inflammation of the ears, with rue and a little honey
to the breasts and to sprainS, with rue and oil to
quinsy, and with onion‚ salt and honey to the bites of
dogs and of humans. By a walnut shell a hollow
tooth is caute1·ized.⁰ If the shell be burnt and
beaten up with the addition of oil or wine, to anoint

growth of hair, and this preparation is also used for
mange. The more walnuts eaten, the easier it is to
expel tape-worms. Very old walnuts are a cure
for gangrenes and carbuncles‚ as also for bruises 3 the
bark ⁰ of walnuts cures lichen and dysentery, and the
pounded leaves with vinegar eure ear-ache. When
the mighty king Mithridates had been overcome‚ Cn.
Pompeius found in a private note-book in his cabinet
a prescription for an antidote written in the king’s
own hand-writing :—two dried walnuts, two figs and
twenty leaves of rue were to be pounded together
with the addition of a pinch of salt3 he who took this
fasting would be immune to all poison for that day.
The kernels of walnuts ehewed by a fasting person
and applied to the bite of a mad dog are said to be a
sovereign remedy.

⁶ Commentators including Fee wonder how this could be
done. Perhaps walnut juice was supposed to have eaustie
properties‚ or imtrilnr may have replaced a word meaning to
serape (with the hardened shell).

⁶ Fee says the bark of the tree and not the shell of the nut.
This view seems probable, for the use of the leaves follows
immediately.

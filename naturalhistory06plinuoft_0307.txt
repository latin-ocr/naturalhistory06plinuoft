chum (otherwise amaracum, sweet marjoram) of which
the most valued, and the most fragrant, comes from
Cyprus, counteracts the stings of scorpions, if applied
in vinegar and salt. An application b is also very bene-
ficial for irregular menstruation. This plant has less
efficacy when taken in drink. With pearl barley it
also checks fluxes from the eyes. The juice of the
boiled plant relieves gripings. The plant is useful
for strangury and dropsy, and in a dry state excites
sneezing. There is also made from it an oil, called
sampsuchinum or amaracinum, used for warming
and softening the sinews, which also wal-ms the
uterus. The leaves too are good with honey for
bruises and with wax for spr ains.

the kinds used in medicine. ſtrfheie aie some who
use the name phrenion. There are two kinds of
it: one is wild, and the other grows on cultivated
ground, though both prefer a sandy soil. Of the
cultivated anemone there are several species; for
it has either a scarlet flower—this is also the most
plentiful—or a purple one, or one the colour of
milk. The leaves of all these are like the leaves of
parsley, and rarely does the plant exceed half a
foot in height, the head resembling that of asparagus.

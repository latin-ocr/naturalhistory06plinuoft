BOOK XXII. κων. 90—XLv. 91

Boiled in oil and in the skin of a pomegranate the root
is also a remedy for complaints of the ears. All these
preparations must be made from the white kind.
Cleemporus says that the dark kind must not be
eaten, because it causes diseases‚ but 116 agrees to
the use of the white. Agathocles asserts that its
juice counteracts even the poison of bull‘sa blood,
yet since it is agreed that the dark kind has cooling
properties‚ pearl barley must therefore be added to
the application. Zeno recommends the root of the
white kind for strangury.

XLV. Condrion ²² or condrille has leaves like those
of endive, eaten away as it were round the eriges,
a stem less than a foot and moist with a bitter
juice, and a root like a bean, occasionally mani-
fold. Next to the ground it grows a gum, an
excrescence the size of a bean,c a pessary of which
is said to promote menstruation. The whole ‘l with
the roots is pounded and divided into lozenges as
an antidote for snake bites, for which treatment
good reason can be adduced, for field mice wounded
by snakes are said to eat it. A decoction of the plant
in wine checks looseness of the bowels. The same
makes an excellent substitute for gum to keep the
eye-lashes tidy, however disordered these may be.
Dorotheus declares in his verses that it is good for
the stomach and the digestionf For the rest, it
has been supposed to be bad for women, for the
eyes, and for the virility of men.

native is probably right here, but later on, where a similar
grammatical ambiguity occurs, eadem . . . pilas inordinatissi-
mos pro cummi reqil must surely refer to the gummy mastvic.

⁶ C'oncocliones may mean: “ maturing of abscesses.''
Cf. note on §123. The plural supports this view, but the
context (stomacho) the meaning ‘⁶ digestion.’'

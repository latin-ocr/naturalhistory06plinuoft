tho fig, fennel-giant‚ and -the gum-exuding trees;
inedible,⁶2 as I have saidss’ are 'chose on the yew, the
robur ¹' and the cypress. But who guarantees such
things in the market? They alld have a leaden
colour. This will give an indication of poison, the
closer it approximates to that of the bark of the tree.
Ι have pointed out? remedies for these poisonous
fungi and shall do so again later on3 in the mean—
time let nie say that even thisf plant produces some
remedies. Glaucias considers that mushrooms are
good for the stoniach. Hog fungi are hung up to dry‚
skewered on a rush as we see them come from Bithy-
nia. These they use as a remedy for the fluxes of the
belly that are called bowel catarrh, and for fleshy
growths on the anus, which they reduce and in
time cause to disappear3 they do the like to freckles
and spots on women's faces. They are also steeped in
water, as lead is, to make an application for diseases of
the eyes. They are applied to septic sores and to
rashes on the head, and in water to dog bites. Ι should

Pears are mentioned at the end of this chapter (ξ 99), and
again in XXIII. §115‚ as a remedy for poisoning by fungi,
but they have not been mentioned before in this connection.
So Pliny, unless speaking inaccurately‚ cannot have said, as
Detlessen would have him say: piri adversus haec diximus
remedia. Otherwise piri is an attractive emendation.

s The better attested reading is hilm but this would refer
to the same things as haec in the previous sentence, i.e.,
poisonous fungi.

drink. They are taken by themselves in rain water to
arrest looseness of the bowels. The root when boilcd
yields a juice which kills nipe—worm, the dose being
one victoriatus by weight. The same root, thoroughly
boiled in water serves the same purposes as lycium.

LXI. There is also a wild pomegranate‚ so called 11'i1dpome-

because of its likeness to the cultivated tree. Its qranrues.

roots, which have a red skin, act as a soporifie if

Its seed taken in drink dries up water under the

LXII. All kinds of pears are indigestible food, Pears-
even for men in licalth: and to the sick they are as
strictly forbidden as wine. Cooked, however, they
are remarkably wholesome and pleasant, especially
those of Crustumium. All kinds of pears, however,
if boiled down with honcy are wholesome to the
stomach. Out of pears are made plasters for dis-
persing flesh lesions, and they use a decoction of
thern for indurations. By themselves they neutralize
the poison of toadstools and nee-fungi, expelling it
by their weiglit in addition to the counteracting effect
of their juice. The wild pear is very slow in ripening.
Sliced the pears are hung up and dried for checking
looseness ofthe bowels, for which purpose a decoction
also ofthem is efficacious, taken as drink. A decoction
also of the leaves with the fruit is used for the same
purposes. The ashes of pear wood are even more
efficacioris against the poison of tree-fungi. Apples
and pears, even a small quantity, make a remarkably
lieavy load for beasts of burden. It is said that a
remedy for this is to give them a few to eat, or at
least to show some, before beginning the journey.

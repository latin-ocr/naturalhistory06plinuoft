and is beneficial, they say, to the hypochondria‚ for
mange and for freckles. I find also that scab in
cattle is very quickly healed by it, and that according
to Nicandera the bites of snakes also, if gathered
before it blossoms‚

CVII. Nor would it be right to describe fully the
cnecos, otherwise atractylis, an Egyptian plant,
were it not for the great help it affords against
venomous creatures as well as against poisonous
fungi. It is a well-known fact that so long as they
hold this plant‚' those stung by scorpions feel no
sharp pain.

CVIII. The Egyptians plant pesoluta too in their
gardens, using it for chaplets. There are two kinds,
female and male3 both, it is said, placed under the
genitals, are antaphrodisiac, especially for men.

CIX. Since I have frequently to use Greek names
when giving weights and measures, Ι will add at
this place their equivalents, once and for all. The
Attic drachma, for it is generally the Attic standard
that physicians adopt, has the weight of a silvei·
denarius, and the same makes six oboli, the obolus
being ten chalci. The cyathus as a measure weighs
ten drachmae; when the measure of an acetabulum
is spoken of, it means the quarter of a hemina, that
is fifteen drachmae. The mna, that our countrymen
call the mina, weighs one hundred Attic drachmae.

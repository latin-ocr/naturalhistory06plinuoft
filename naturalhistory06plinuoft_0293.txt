LXXXII. The lees too of the saffron extracted

from saffron juice‚‘² which is called crocomagma,
have their own uses for cataract and strangury. It
is more warming than saffron itself. The best kind
is that which, when put in the mouth, stains with
the truest saffron colour the saliva and the teeth.
LXXXIII. The red iris is better than the white
one. It conduces to the health of babies to have
this tied on them, especially when they are teething
or suffering from cough, and to inject it into those
troubled with tape-worms. Its other properties are
not much different from those of honey. It cleanses
sores on the head, especially abst-esses of long
standing. Taken in doses of two drachmae with
honey it relaxes the bowels; taken in drink it
relieves cough, griping and flatulence, in vine-gar,
complaints of the spleen. In vinegar and water it
is an antidote against the bites of snakes and of
spiders; against stings of scorpions two drachmae
by weight are taken in bread or water; for dog-bites
and abrasions it is applied in oil. So prepared it is
also applied to aching sinews, but for lumbago and
sciatica resin is added. Its nature is warming.
Snuffed up through the nostrils it promotes sneezing
and clears the head. For headache it is a ›plied
with quinces or with span-row-qrriuces. It dispeJls also
'the after-effects of wine and orthopnoea. Taken in
doses of two oboli it acts as an emetic. Applied with
honey it draws out splinters of broken bone. For
whitlows its meal is used, wine being added for corns
and warts, the plaster not being removed for three

the gender of crocomaqma. The Bohn version makes unquento
crocino dative and quod as relative to crocmnaqma, and it must
be confessed that the Latin may be thus construed.

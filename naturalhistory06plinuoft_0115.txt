cultivated kind in the appearance of its leaves, which
have the shape of those of ocimum and the smel] of
pennyroyal, for which reason some call it wild
pennyroyal. If these leaves are chewed and applied,
elephantiasis is cured, as was discovered in the time
of Pompeius Magnus by the chance experiment of
some one who for shame smeared his face with thern.
The same leaves are applied, 01· taken in drink, for
the bites of serpents, in doses of two drachmae in
two cyathi of wine, for the stings of scorpions with
salt, oil and vinegar; for the wound of the scolo—

are dried to a powder and kept as an antidote for
all poisons. Spread out or burnt, the plant drives
away even scorpions. Taken in drink it brings on
menstruation, but it kills the foetus. For ruptures,
spasms, orthopnoea, cholie and cholera it is very
beneficial, and an externa] application is so for
lumbago and gout. The juice is injected into ears
that are infected with parasites. It is taken in
drink for jaundice‚ and applied as ointment for
scrofula3 it prevents amorous dreams, and if taken
in vinegar expels worms; for dandrnff, vinegar
with the plant in it is poured over the head in the
sun.

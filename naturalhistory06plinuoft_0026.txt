telling. It does not surprise us that in several places
Pliny speaks of Magian vanitas, so large was the
clement of witchcraft and sorcery.

By the time of Pliny, however, the word Magus
had lost much of its association with the East. This
is well illustrated by a sentence in XVI. ἓ 249: nihil

arbore in qua gignatur, sz' modo sit robur, sacratius.
Mayhoff has here a small “ m,'' as though to mark
that the word in this context is not a proper, but a
common noun. Moreover, in ξ 11 of Book XXX
Pliny speaks of a magices factio α illese et Ianne et
Lotape ac Iudaeis pendens, words suggesting that
magice in the first century Ap. included much that
would be called to-day thaumaturgy. Incidentally,
it may be noticed that in ancient times conjuring
was not yet distinguished from “ black magic.’' lt
is easier now to separate honest deception from
dishonest; in ancient times they were hopelessly
confused, as were also legitimate “ suggestion '⁵ and
witchcraft. A sceptical mind would regard all magice
as fraud, a superstitious mind would accept it all as
truly miraculous‚ and ordinary men were puzzled and
uncertain. We can be sure, however, that on the
whole credulity outweighed scepticism, as it did until
the commonplaces of modern science leavened the
popular mind. Vl'itches are no longer burned alive,
and those who entertain superstitious beliefs are
laughed at. Unless we remember this difference
between ancient and modern times we cannot fully
appreciate the almost venomous attack of Lucretius

oblong is called cyperis, being widely used in
medicine.d The most valued cyperos comes from
the region round the temple of Hammon, the second

last from Egypt; as the cypiros also grows there,
some confusion of thought results. But cypiros has

in medicine is to act as a depilatory. It makes an
ointment for hang-nafis, sores of the genitals and all
sores that are in moisture‚ such as those in the
mouth. Its root affords an effective remedy for the
bites of snakes and stings of scorpions. The root
taken in drink opens the passage of the uterus, but
if taken in too strong doses its potency is great
enough to cause prolapsus. It promotes urine and
the passing of stone, and therefore is most useful to
sufferers from dropsy. It is applied to spreading

wine or in vinegar.

cypiros; a differenee between Egyptian cypiros and other
varieties of it, is surely irrelevant.

was driven from Italy‚<2 and the crown was the only
one placed on the recipient's head by the hand of
the State itself, and—a special feature in the case of

distinction the proud surname of Felix, nevertheless
he himself resigned to Sertorius this crown when
he besieged the proscribed in every part of the
world. Scipio Aemilianus also was, according to

but there is no need to go into more details even for
the sake of giving a waruing. There is besides
another kind, with the name of halicacabos, which
is soporific, and kills quicker even than opium, by
some called morion and by others moly, yet praised
by Diocles and Evenor, by Timaristus indeed even
in verse, with a strange forgetfulness of harmless
rcrnedies, actually because it is, they say, a quick
remedy for strengthening loose teeth to rinse thern
in wine and halicacabos. They added a proviso, that
the rinsing must not go on too long, for delirium is
caused thereby. Remedies should not be described
the use of which involves the danger of a yet more
serious evil. Accordingly, although a third kind of
this plant is in favour as a fond, and although its
flavour is preferred to that of other garden produce,
and although Xenocrates prescribes trychnos as
being beneficial for every bodily ill, yet the genus
is not so helpful that I consider it right on this
account to give any more details, especially when the
supply is so abundant of harmless remedies. The
root of halicacabos is taken in drink by those who,
to confirm superstitious notions, wish to play the
inspired prophet, and to be publiely seen raving in
unpretended madness. The remedy for it, which
I am happier to mention, is a copious draught of
hot hydromel. Nor will Ι pass over this: that hali-
cacabos is so antipathetic to the nature of asps that if
its root be brought near it stupefies that very power
of theirs to kill by stupefaction. Therefore pounded
and in oil it is a help to those who have been bitten.

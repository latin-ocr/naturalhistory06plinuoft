name of which is onochilon, called by some people
anchusa, or archebi0n‚ or onochelis, or rhexia, and
by many enchrysa. It has a short base‚'’ a purple
flower, rough leaves and branches, a root blood-red at
harvest time, though dark at other times, growing
on sandy soils, an antidote to the bites of serpents,
especially of vipers, both root and leaves being
equally efficacious in food and in drink. Its proper-
ties are strong-est at harvest time. Its leaves when
pounded give out the smell of cucumber. It is given
111 doses of three cyathi for prolapsus of the uterus.
With hyssop it also drives out tape-worms‚ and for
pain of the kidneys or liver it is taken in hydromel‚

is applied locally for freekles and leprous sores. It
is said that while having it on their person people
are never bitten by serpents. There is also another
plant similar to this, but smaller‚ with a red flower,
which is also used for the same purposes. It is said
that if this plant be chewed, and then spat out on a
serpent, the serpent dies.

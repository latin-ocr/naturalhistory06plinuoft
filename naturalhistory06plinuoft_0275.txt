more useful than others. Some botanists also dis-
tinguish as a separate class a triangular rush, which
they call cyperos, though many do not recognize a
distinction because of the resemblance of the name
to cypiros. I however shall keep each distinct.
Cypiros is, as Ι have sai(l,‘¹ the same as gladiolus,

and has a bulbous root. The most esteemed grows ια

in the island of Crete, the next in Naxos andsthen
comes that of Phoenicia. The Cretan is white, with
a smell like that of nard3 the Naxian has a more
pungent smell, the Phoenician a faint one, and the
Egyptian (for it grows there also) none at all. Cypiros
dispels hard formations of the body, for we must
now speak of remedies‚ as there is a wide b use in
medicine of flowers and perfumes ⁰ ge1ierally.‘¹ As for
cypiros, Ι shall follow Apollodorus who said that it
should never be taken in drink; yet he maintained
its great efficacy for stones in the bladder‚ which by
this means he tries to remove.e He has no doubt
that it causes miscarriage in women, and records
the following strange account of it. Some foreign
people, he says, take into the mouth smoke from this
plant and thereby reduce the spleen, asserting that
they do not leave their homes without inhaling this
smoke, as the habit produces, even from day to day,
increased briskness and greater strength. He adds

⁰ Unguents are included among odores.

‘¹ The addition of ymeri, which at first sight seems otiose,
means that the class as a whole is of great use.

⁶ Mayhoff’s text: ‘⁴ He uses it as a fomentation for the
face.’' We expect, however, a contrast to neqabat bibendum,
and some reading, similar to Mayhoff's conjecture et potu,
bringing out the inconsistency of Apollodorus, should prob-
ably be adopted. But, as Mayhoff remarks, “ omnia
dubia.'¹

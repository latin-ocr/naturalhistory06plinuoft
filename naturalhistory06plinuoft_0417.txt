my opinion not yet used in the age of Pompey⁶
the Great, and for that reason scarcely anything
about it has been written by the school of Ascle-

arresting looseness of the bowels alica is roastech and
then honeycomb wax is cooked with it, as I have said
above.d It is however specially useful for those who
by long illness have been reduced to a consumptive
condition3 the dose is three cyathi put into a
sextarius of water and gradually boiled down until
all the water has evaporated, when a sextarius of
sheep’s or goats’ milk is added, and the mixture
taken daily3e after a while honey also is added.
By a course of this gruel decline is arrested.

bowels and removes gripings‚ for which purposes it is
first roasted. For pains of the sinews, and for other
pains it is applied hot in a bag! No other applica-

and very retentive of heat. Accordingly it is much
used in all cases where the application of heat is
likely to prove beneficial. Millet meal and liquid

pitch are applied to the wounds inflicted by snakes
and multipedes.

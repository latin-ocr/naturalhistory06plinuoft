BOOK XXII. 111. 3—5

serveda to colour the military cloaks of our generals,
Transalpine Gaul can produce with vegetable dyes
Tyrian purple, oyster purple ὁ and all other colours.
To get these nobody seeks the murex oyster in the
depths, offering his person as bait to sea monsters
while 116 hastens to snatch his booty, and exploring
a bottom that no anchor yet has touched, merely
to discover the means for a matron to 61131111 1161
paramour more easily and for a seducer to en-
snare another's wife. There 0116 stands on land
to harvest dyes as we harvest crops; and though
there is a complaint that the dye washes out with
use, except for this defect luxury could have be-
decked itself in brighter 60101115, and certainly with
less risk to life. It is not my intention now to
treat this subject fully, but Ι shall not pass it over
entirely, so that I may, by suggesting 611631161-
materials, curb luxury by expediency, and 011
another occasion I shall tell how walls are dyed
instead of being painted in mosaicss Yet Ι should
not have left out the craft of dyeing altogether,
had it ever been included among the liberal arts.
In the meantime I shall take a holder line, and
there shall be assigned even 10 (11111, that is to say,
lowly plants all the dignity that 15 their due, since
it 15 a fact that the founders and enlargers of the
Roman Empire derived from this source also an
immense advantage, because it was from them that
came the tufts used when the State needed cures,⁰l
and also the vervains required in holy ceremonies
not commit the mistake of curbing, by suggesting cheaper
materiale, luxury by expediency, although I shall on another
occasion, etc.’' See XXXV. § 118.

‘² In times of national emergency, e.9., plague, a solemn
lectisternium was held, in which a ιςαφηιεη (or verbena) was used.

LXXVI. There are both wild and cultivated
violets. The mauve ones are cooling and are applied

water. The mauve variety, taken in water, is a cure
for epilepsy, especially in children. The seed of the
violet neutralizes the stings of scorpions. On the
other hand the flower of the white violet opens

white violet, however, and the yellow reduce the

gathered they have less potency, for which reason
they should be dried and not used until they are at
least a year old. Half a cyathus of the yellow violet
taken in three of water promotes menstruation. Its
roots used with vinegar as a liniment soothe the
splecm and likewise gout, but for inflammat-jons of
the eyes myrrh and saffron should be added to them.
The leaves ὸ with honey cleanse sores on the head.

likcwise fluxes from the eyeS. It is applied to breasts

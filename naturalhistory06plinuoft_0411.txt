as well. In the first place it is a well known fact that
those animals that seed on grain are the most intelli-
gent. Grains of common wheat well roasted and then
crushed, applied in Aminean wine to the eyes soothe
fluxes; nioreover‚ well roasted on an iron plate
grains of naked wheat are a quick remedy for frost-
bite. The flour of naked wheat boiled in vinegar is
good for cranip; the bran moreover and rose oil,
dried figs and sebesten plums‚ all boiled down, make
a good gargle for tonsils and throat. Sextus Pom—
ponius, father of a man who was praetor, himself the
most distinguished man α in Nearer Spain, was
superintending the winnowing in his barns when he
was seized with the pains of gout. Burying himself
above his knees into the wheat he was relieved of the
pain, and the water in his feet dried up in a wonderful
way, so that. afterwards he adopted this procedure as
a remedy. The absorbent power of wheat is so great
that it dries up casks full of liq11icl.b Experieneed
authorities also prescribe the ehaff of wheat or barley
to be applied warni for he1·nia‚⁰ and the water in
which it has been boiled to be used for fomenta-
tions. There is to be found in emmer-wheat a little
worm like the wood—worm. If this be plugged with
wax into the hollow ofa deeayed tooth, it is said that
the tooth comes out, or even if the affected part be
rubbed with it. Olyra (two—grained wheat) is, as I
have said,d also called arinca. With a decoction of
it a medicine is made which the Egyptians call
athera, very benefieial for babieS, though adults too
use it as a liniment.

⁰ Pliny often uses incommoda for ailments; e.g.‚ inconmoda
corporum, pulmonum, vesicae.

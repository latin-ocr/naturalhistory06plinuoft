fresh dog bites, with wine corroding sores, and
with poppy leaves they extract splinters of bone.
Wild figs when green disperse flatulence by
fumigation ⁰-taken in drink they are an antidote to
bulls' blood that has been swallowed, to white lead
and to curdled milk-—and boiled down in water they
disperse when used as a liniment sores of the parotid
glands. The young stalks or green fruit of the wild
fig, plucked when as small as possible, are taken in
wine to counteract scorpion stings. The milk, too, is
poured into a wound and the leaves are applied to it,
and the same treatment is employed for the bite of
the shrew-rnouse. The ash of the young shoots
soothes a sore uvula3 the ash of the tree itself applied
in honey cures chaps, and the root boiled down in
wine cures toothache. The winter wild fig, boiled
in vinegar and beaten up, clears up eczema. The
branches with the bark removed are seraped to pro-
duce particles as fine as sawdust, which are used as
an application. The wild fig too ὁ has one miraculous
medicinal property attributed to it; if a boy not yet
adolescent break off a branch and tears off with his
teeth its bark swollen with sap, the mere pith tied
on as an amulet before sunrise keeps away, it is said,
scrofulous sores. The wild fig, if a branch be put
round the neck of a bull, however fierce, by its
miraculous nature so subdues the animal as to make
him incapable of movement.

LXV. A plant too, called erinos by the Greeks,
must be described here because of the kinship ⁰ of
its name. It is a span high, and generally has five
small stalks; it resembles basil, with a white flower

⁶ That is, to the name of the wild fig (ἐρινεός, ἐρινός, wild
lig-tree, and ἔρινος, a kind of basil).

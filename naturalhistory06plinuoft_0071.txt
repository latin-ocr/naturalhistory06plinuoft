in the abdomen.‘² White lettuce in great quantity
is given to melancholic ²³ patients and for bladder
troubles. Praxagoras gave it also to patients with
dysentery. It 1s &good for fresh burns, if applied with
salt before the blisters form. They check spre¹1di11g
ulcer‚s if applied at first with saltpetre‚ afterwards
in wine. Pounded they are applied in cases of
erysipelas. 'Ille pounded stalks‚ added to pearl-barley
and applied with cold water, soothe cramps and
sprains, and eruptions of pimples when applied with
wine and pearl-barley. In cholera ⁶ also they have
been given cooked in a pan, for which purpose the
most beneficial are the bitter ones with the lirgest
stems. Some people too inject the lettuce milk!l
Their stalks thoroughly boiled are said to be very
beneficia] to the stomach3 likewise for sleep the
summer lettuce especially, and the milky, bitter
kind, which we have called 1116601113.ρ This milk
added to woman's milk is prescribed also as very
useful for clearness of vision if the eyes and the head
are bathed in good time, and likewise for eye troubles
caused by chill. I find much other extravagant
praise of lettuce: that with Attic honey it is as good
as southernwoods for chest complaints3 that men—
struation is regulated by its use as food; that the
seed of cultivated lettuce is given for scorpion stings ;
that the crushed seed taken in wine prevents libidi-
nous drean1s3 that noxiouso waters do not harm
those who eat lettuce. Some however have main-
tained that when eaten too often they impair the
eye-sight.

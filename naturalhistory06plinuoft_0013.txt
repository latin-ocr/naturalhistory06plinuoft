INTRODUCTION
Boons XX—XXVII of Pliny's Natural Historgs are

concerned with the uses of trees, plants and flowers‚
especially in medicine. To understand hi< treat-
ment of this subject it is necessary to examine the
diseases he dealt with and the nature of the remedies
he prescribed.

DISEASES or ΙΤΑιγ, AND Timm NAMES 1N Pva.

The chief diseases in Pliny’s day were those of
the obest, skin and eyes, together with the various
forms, intermittent or remittent, of malaria (agne).
The ordinary infectious severs—smallpox‚ measles‚
scarlet sever, diphtheria, enteric, influenza-—were
apparently unknown. Enteric is doubtful, because
it is so like certain types of remittent malaria‚ which
was very prevalent, that only the mici-oscope can
distinguish between them. Plague (pestis, pesti-
lentia) often appeared in epidemic form, and, when
not malignant malaria‚ was probably typhus or
bubonie plague. The main difficulty met when
attempting to find modern equivalents sor ancient
diseases is due to the old method of diagnosis, that
is, by general symptoms. Two cases superficially
alike were usually called by the same name. Many
things besides gout were included under podagra,
many besides leprosy under lepra, many besides
cancer under carcinoma.

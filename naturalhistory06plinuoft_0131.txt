plaints, pains in the side when mixed into a broth
with meal, oil and vinegar, but especially the bites
of serpents.

LXIII. There is a third kind, which the Greeks
call male cunila, and the Romans cunilag03 it has
a foul smell, wood-like root and a rough leaf. Of
all varieties of cunila it is said that this has the
strongest quahties, that a handful of it thrown
about attracts all the cockroaches in the whole house,
that taken in vinegar and water it is a specifie
against scorpions, and that if a man be rubbed
over with threea leaves in oil serpents are kept
awa .

LYXIV. On the other hand the cunila called soft
has shaggier and prickly branehes, and when pounded
the sniell of honey, the fingers sticking together at
its touch; a second variety smells of frankincense,
and we have called it libanotisst' Either kind in wine
or vinegar is an antidote against the bites ofserpents ;
furthermore‚ pounded and seattered about in water
both varieties kill fleas.

LXV. Cultivated cunila too has its uses. The
juice with rose oil is good for the ear-laps, and it is
taken by itself in drink for stings. From it grows
the mountain variety, which is like wild thyme and
efficacious against the bites of serpents. It is
diuretic and eleanses after child-birth. Wild or
cultivated it is a wonderful stimulus to digestion and
to the appetite, or relieves indigestion taken fasting
and sprinkled in a drink. Useful too for sprains,
taken in barley meal with vinegar and water it is
very useful for the stings of wasps and the like.
Other kinds of libanotis will be dealt with in their
proper place.

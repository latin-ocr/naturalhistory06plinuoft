lost through mange. Raw quinces preserved in honey
move the bowels. They add much to the pleasant
taste α of homey, and make it more beneficial to the
stomach. Boiled quinces preserved in honey and beat-
en up with a decoction of rose leaves are given by some
as food for the treatment of affections of the stomach.
The juice of raw quinces is good for the spleen‚
difficulty of breathing, and dropsy‚ as well as for the
breasts, condylomata and varicose veinS, and the
flowers‚ both fresh and dried, for inflammations of
the eyes, spitting of blood, and to regulate menstru-
ation. A soothing Juice is also derived from quinces
by pounding them with sweet wine, which is good
ior coeliae affections and the liver. A decoction of
them is also used to foment piolapsus of the uterus
and of the intestines. An oil also is extracted from
them, which I have called inelinum‚¹' provided that ⁶
the fruit is not grown on wet soil. Hence the most
useful are the quinces imported from Sicily; while
the sparrow quince, although nearly related, is not
so good. The root of the quince tree, after a ring
has been drawn round it, is pulled up with the left
hand, the person doing so being careful to state why
he is pulling it, and for whom. An amulet from
such a root cures scrofulous sores.

LV. Honey applesd and the other sweet kinds
relax the stomach and bowels‚ cause thirst and heat,
but do no injury to the sinews. Round‘ apples
arrest looseness of the bowels and vomitings, and act
as a diuretic. Wild apples are like sour spring
apples and arrest looseness of the bowels; indeed for
this purpose they must be used while uni-ipe.

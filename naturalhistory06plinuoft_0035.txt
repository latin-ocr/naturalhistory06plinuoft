BOOK XX. 11. 3-111. 5

ΙΙ. We have saida that there is a wild cucumber Cucumbm.
much smaller than the cultivated kind. From it Zffrim..
is made the drug called elaterium by pressing the purae·
juiee out of the seed. Unless, to prepare it, the
cueumber be cut open before it is ripe, the seed
spurts out, even endangering the eyeS. After
being gaffiered, the cucumber is kept for one night
and then cut open on the next day with a reed.
The seed too is kept in ash to prevent the juice
from running away. This when pressed oui is
received in rain water, where it falls to the bottom.
Then it is thickened in the sun, and made into
lozenges for the great benefit of mankind, being
good for dim vision, eye diseases and sores of the
eyelids.b It is said that if the roots of vines are
touched by this juiee the grapes are not attacked by
birds. The root too when boiled in vinegar is used
as ointment in cases of gout, and its juice cures
toothache. Dried and mixed with resin it heals
impetigo, itch, what are called psora and lichen,
parotid swellings and superficial al)scesses;⁶ it
restores the natural colour to scam, while the juice
ofthe leaves mixed with vinegar and poured by drops=
into the ears is a remedy for deafness.

III. The proper season to prepare elaterium is
the autumnfl and no drug keeps for a longer period.
It begins to be potent when three years old; if it
is desired to use it earlier, the lozenges must be
made less harsh by warming them in vinegar in
a new clay pot over a slow sire. The older it is the
better, and it has been known to keep, so Theo-
phrastuse tells us, for two hundred years, and its
power to put out the flame of a lamp it retains rig-ht
up to the fiftieth year. Indeed‚ the test of genuine

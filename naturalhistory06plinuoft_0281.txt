themselves, when 1116 nafis, in which there is most
moisture‚ are not removed; or when what is left
after removing the nails is steeped with oil or wine
in glass vessels in the sunshine. Some add salt also,

it becomes 35 thick as honey. For this process only
the most fragrant petals must be selected.⁶ How

Fluxes of the eyes also are soothed by the dried
leaves. The flower induces sleep, checks menstrual,

and water, as well as the spitting ofblood 3 3 cyathus 9

qnantum or tantum of the MSS. could be retained if either word,
perhaps with the addition of some such word as sufficit, were

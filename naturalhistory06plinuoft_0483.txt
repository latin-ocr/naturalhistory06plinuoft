stinging animals and for the bite of the multipede.
Applied warm on a sponge, with either two ounces of
sulphur or a bunch of hyssop added to three sextarii
of vinegar, it is also a remedy for troubles of the anus.
For haemorrhage after excision of stone, or any other,
it is applied externally on a spongo, and doses of two
cyathi of the strongest vinegar are taken internally.
It certainly disperses clotted blood. In the treat-

throat‚ orthopnoea‚ and looseness of the teeth. It
is injurious to the bladder and to weak sinews. Its
great efficacy as an antidote for asp bite was un-
known to physicians‚ but recently a man who was
bitten by an asp on which he trod while carrying a
skin of vinegar felt the w ound every time he put the
skin down, but at other times it was as though 116

of it. And it is similarly with vine-gar that those
rinse out their mouth who suck poison from wounds.

cummim, or heightened by pepper and laserwort,
and without fail is kept in check by salt. On this
point I must not pass over a striking illustration of
the power of vinegar. In the last years of his life

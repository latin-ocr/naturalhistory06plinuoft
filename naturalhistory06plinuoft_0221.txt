estet-med is found in Illyria, and even there nost in
the coastal districts. but in the woody parts near
the Drinon and aronnd Narona. cht after it comes
the Macedonian iris. which is white, thin and very
long. Third in estimation eomes the African iris,
which is the largest of all and the bitterest to the
taste. The Illyrian mox-eover is of two kinds:
raphanitis, so called from its likeness to the radish,
which is the better kind, and rhizotomos. The best,
which is reddish, causes sneezing if handled‚ and has
an upright stem a cubit high. The flower is multi-
coloured. like the rainbow; hence the name ‘⁶ iris. ''
The Pisidian variety, too, is by no means despised.
Those who are going to dig it up pour hydromel
around it three months previously. This is as it were
a libation to please the earth. Then they draw
three cireles round it with the point of a sword,
gather it and at once raise it heaven-wards. It is
hot by nature, and when handled raises blisters like
those of a burn. It is especially enjoined that those
who gather it should be chaste. Not only when dried,
but also when in the ground, it is very easily subject
to worms. Previously the best iris oil used to be
brought from Leucas and Elis—for it has been
planted there a long time—now the best comes
from Pamphylia, but the Cilician too is highly
praised, as is also that coming from the northerna
arts.
p XX. Celtic nard has leaves that are rather short,
and cannot be plaited. It is held together by its
many roots, being really a grass rather than a flower,
matted as though squeezed by hand3 in short, it is
a unique kind of turf. Pannonia grows it, and the

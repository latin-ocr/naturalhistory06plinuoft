INTRODUCTION

Tm: ssomw or PLxNv.

The identification of plants mentioned in the
Natural History is a difficult matter. Pliny was not
a botanist, but derived his information froin books,
which were often read aloud to him while he took
notes, and not studied at leisure. Naturally he
made mistakes due to misunderstandings. Pliny’s
authorities again were sometimes inadequate or
confused or even wrong. In addition to the diffi-
culties caused by positive error, there is also another
one due to the fact that the same name was often
given to more than one plant, and the same plant
was often called by more than one name. Accord-
ingly even a trained botanist hesitates at times to
give with any confidence the modern equivalent of
an ancient name in some particular context. Some-
times, of course, there is no reasonable doubt; rosa
is rose, and cepa onion. Often, however, even when
certain that a Latin or Greek name is generally
equiv alent to an F nglish one, the botanist' is not sure
that a variety included by Plim, or Theophrastus
under the former should also be included under the
latter. The degree of doubt may vary from a moral
certainty to a slight suspicion. Typical difficulties
are those facing the translator when he has to render
into English asparagus, hyacinthus and strychnos. To
keep the Latin name always would be consistent,
but cumbersome and pedantic. It seems better to
give the English name when the risk of error is slight,
but to keep the Latin when the risk is great. An
index of plants‚‘² with probable or possible identi-
fications, should give most readers the information

‘¹ This index is in course of preparation, and will appear at
the end of Pliny's botany books.

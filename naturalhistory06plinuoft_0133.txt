quase-usust is taken in drink for epilepsy. Castor&
gave a further description of it : ⁶ ‘⁶ a red, long stem,
with its knots close together3 leaves like those of
the bay; a white, small seed, with a taste like
pepper; good for the gums, teeth, sweetness of

flavour, as Ι have said, ‘² has many varieties useful in'
medicine. One is onitis‚ called by some prasion,

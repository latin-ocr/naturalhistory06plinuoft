BOOK XXII. Lxm. 131-LX1v. 133

LXIII. Italian millet was called by the physician
Diocles the honey α of cereals. It produces the same
results as common millet. Taken in wine it is good
for dysentery. In like form it is applied hot where
warm fomentations are called for. Looseness of the
bowels is cheeked if a (1000011011 111 goats’ milk is
taken twice a day. In this form it is also good for
gripings.

LXIV. Sesame ground and taken in wine checks
vomiting. It is applied to inflammation of the ears
and to burns. It has the same effect ὓ even while it
is in the blade. For this reason it 15 more copiously
applied, deeocted in wine, to the eyeS. As a food
it is injurious to the stomach and causes the breath
to smell offensive.c It neutralizes the bites of the
gecko, and is beneficial to the sores known as malig-
nant 3‘1 the oil made from it, as I have 50111,ρ is good for
the ears. Sesamo'idess has received its name from its
likeness to sesame3 it has a smaller leaf, and the
grain is bitter. It grows on gravelly soils. Taken
in water, it carries away bile. The seed is used as
an application for erysipelas, and it disperses super-
ficial abscesses.

There is also another sesamoides‚9 which grows at
Anticyra, and is therefore called by some Anti·
cyricon. It has the seed of sesame, but in other
respeets is like the plant erigeron about which I shall
speak in the proper place. '¹ A three- finger pinoh is
given in sweet wine as a purge. There they mix with

pinoh purges upwards if taken with 111100 half· oboli of white
hellebore added 10 honey and water. He says 1101111110 about
sweet wine, 11111 (1005 say that σησαμοειδές 15 11111οΓ. There is
no reference to melancholia. This 15 a pass 5030 that throws

some light on the relation between 1)1050011(105 and Pliny.

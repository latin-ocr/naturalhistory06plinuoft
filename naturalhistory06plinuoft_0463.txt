Chironia, by others gynaecanthe or apronia, similar
to the preceding except for the colour3 for that is, as
I have said, dark. Diocles preferred its shoots to the
real asparagus as a food for promoting urine and
reducing the spleen. It is to be found growing
mostly in shrubberies and reed beds. Its root is
dark outside, but inside of the colour of box-wood.
Splintered bones are extracted by it even more
effectively than by the vine mentioned above3 in
other respects it has the same properties.a It is a
special feature of it that it is a specific for the sores
that come on the necks of beasts of burden. It is
said that if one grows it round a country house
hawks keep away, and the poultry are kept safe.
It also heals‚ in beast or man, if ticd round the
ankles, congestion of blood that may have settled

between the two: from some there can be made
wine, from others raisin wine. Manufacture makes
innumerable differences, so that the general survey
that follows will have to suffice. All must is
injurious to the stomach but comforting to the veins.
If drunk rapidly after a bath without taking breath,
death ensues. It is an antidote to the poisonous
nature of cantharides ὸ and to the bites of serpents,
especially of haemorrhois 0 and of the salamander.

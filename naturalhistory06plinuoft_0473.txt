BOOK XXIII. xxm. 41 -44

checking looseness of the bowels should not drink at
all at meals and but sparingly after. To drink while
fasting is a recent innovation that is very injurious to
those absorbed in business and trying to keep their
mind aetiv ely on the alei-,t In or·de1 to induce sleep‚
how ev er, and to banish worries wine was so taken
long ago, as we see from Homer' 5α Helena, who
servedo wine before food. So too it passed into a
proverb that “ wine befogs the wits.'' It is to wine
that we men should attribute the fact that of animals
we alone drink when we are not thirsty. To drink
w ater at intervals during bouts' 15 very helpful as it is
also to drink it after a prolonged bout. Intoxieation
indeed is immediately banished by a draught of eold
u ater. Hesiod b recommends the use of strong ¹⁴
draughts of wine for twenty days before and twenty
days after the rising of the Dog-star. Neat wine
indeed is a remedy for poison by hemlock‚ coriander, '
aconite, mistlet0e‚ opium, mercury‚ for the wounds
of bees, w asps, hornets, spiders, snakes and scorpions‚
and for all poisons that harm by chilling, especially
for those of the haemorrhois, the prester, and of
tree fungi; also for flatulence and gnawings of the
hypochondria, for violent vomitings from the
stomach‚ and if the belly or intestines suffer from
catarrh 3 for dysentery, and for sweats after prolonged
coughing, while, for eye-fluxes the wine should be
slightly diluted. For cardine ἆ affections it is beneficial
to apply to the left breast neat wine on a sponge ; but
for all these purposes the best to use is white wine
that is growing old. It is also useful to foment the
testicles with warm wine, and administered through

disease, some form of syncope or eollapse. The latter seems
to be the meaning in ξ 50, and therefore perhaps here also.

diuretic, aids the menses and the after-birth, and
restores bruises to their natural colour if they are
fomented with a decoction of the seed. Applied
with white of egg, or boiled in water and drunk,
parsley cures kidney troubles, and ulcers in the
mouth when pounded up in cold water. The seed
with wine, or the root with old wine, breaks up stones
in the bladder. The seed is also given, in white
wine, to jaundice patients.

XLV. Hyginus gives the name of apiastrum to
melissophyllum, but by general consent the Sar-
dinian variety is condemned as poisonous; I must
however include in the same class all plants so placed
by Greek writers.

XLVI. Olusatrum (alexanders), also called hippo-
selinum (horse parsley), is antipathetic to scorpions.
Its seed taken in drink cures colic and intestinal
worms. The seed too, boiled and drunk in honey
wine, cures dysuria. Its root, boiled in wine, ex-
pels stone, besides curing lumbago and pains in the
side. Taken in drink and applied as liniment it
cures the bite of a mad dog. A draught of its juices
warnis those who have been chilled. A fourth kind
of parsley is made by some authorities out of oreo-
selinum (mountain parsley), a straight shrub a palm
high, with a seed like cummin, beneficia] to the urine
and the menses. Heleoselinum (wild celery) is
especially valuable for the bites of spiders ; this variety
and oreoselinum taken in wine promotes the menses.

XLVII. Another kind of parsley, which grows on Rock parsley,

rocks, is called by some petroselinum (rock parsley);
it is especially good for abscesses, two spoonfuls of
the juice making a dose with one cyathus of juice
of horehound and three cyathi of warm water.

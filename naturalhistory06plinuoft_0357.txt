their kinds are an antidote to the sting of the
scorpion.

XXII. Hartshorn is a longish plant with fissures.‘¹ llarsshorn
Sometimes it is cultivated, because its root, roasted
in hot ashes, is a splendid remedy for coeliae

com laints.

X}XIII. Alkanet too has a useful root, which is of Ala-anet
the thickness of a finger. It is split into small divi· ἷῖῇῗῖζζῗξζ
sions like the papyrus, and stains the hands the
colour of blood; it prepares wools for costly colours.²²
Applied in wax ointment it heals ulcerous sores,
especially those of the aged, and also burns. In-
soluble in water, it dissolves in oil‚ and this is the
test of genuineness. A drachma of it is given to
be taken in wine for pains in the kidneys, or if there
be fever. in a decoction of behen nut3 also for
affections of the liver and spleen and for violent
biliousness. It is applied in vinegar to leprous sores
and freckles. The pounded leaves, with honey and
meal, are applied to sprains, and doses of two drach-
mae in honey wine check looseness of the bowels.
Fleas are said to be killed by a decoction of the root
in water.

XXIV. There is also another plant, which being
like alkanet is called bastard alkanet, though some
call it echis ⁰ or doris ἆ or by many other names3 it
is more downy than the other and less fleshy‚ the
leaves are thinner and more flabby. The root in
oil does not give out a red juice, by which test it is
distinguished from true alkanet. The leaves or
seed taken in drink are a very sure antidote to snake
bite. The leaves are applied to stings and bites, and
their strong smell keeps snakes away. A draught
too is made from the plant for affections of the spine.

One is thorny and cul-led, which is the shorter; the
other is smooth‚ and is called by some paederos,

and those threatened with consuniption; for which

be among the vegetables growing wild. It has a
stem a cubit high, many and long leaves, and the
head of dill. Hippocrates recommends it as a food‚
Glauco and Nicander θ as a medicine. Its seed coun-

and as a diui-esic.

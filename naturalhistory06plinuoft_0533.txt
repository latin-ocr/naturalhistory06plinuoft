and small black seed. Pounded and added to Attio
honey this seed cures fluxes of the eyes, the
proportions being two cyathi to four drachmae of
Attio honey. When broken this plant distils much
sweet milk, which with the addition of a little soda
is very beneficia] for eai·-ache.‘² The leaves are an
antidote to poisons.

LXVI. The leaves of the plum boiled in wine are
good for tonsils, gums and uvula, the mouth being
rinsed with this decoction occasionally. ⁰ 'Ihe fruit
by itself relaxes the boweIS, but' is not vei-&y ‹rood for
the stomach, though its effeets are transitory.

LXVII. Peaches are more wholesome, and so is
their juice, which is also squeezed out and taken in
wine or vinegar. No other food is more harmless
than this fruit, · nowhere do we find less smell or more

Peach kernels mixed with oil and vinegar make an
application good for headache.

came from Dioscorides. See IV 141 (Wellman): τούτου ό
καρπὸς δραχμῶν δυεῖν πλῆθος μιγεις πρὸς μέλιτος πλῆθος δραχμῶν
τεσσάρων ἐγχριόμενος ῥεύματα ρφθαλμῶν” ιστησιν. ὁ δὲ χυλὸς
αὐτὸς πόνον παύει μετὰ θειόυ’ απύρου και νίτρου ἐνσταζόμενος.

⁶ Dioscorides I 121: τὸ δε ἀφέψημα τῶν φύλλων εν οἴνῳ
σκευαζόμενον και ζἀναγαργαριζόμενον κιονιδα καὶ οὖλα καὶ
παρίσθμια ρευματιζο ενα στέλλει (Of the κοκκυμηλέα). This
supports my rea ing as ειςειὶηὲῒ, Mayhoff' 8, founded on
Gargilius, but the parallel is not very close. Gargilius has
(ex oleribus et pomis XLVI de pruno p. 192 Rose): aqua in
qua prum folia decocta sunl yinyivas et uvam *itemque tonsillas ab
omni querela ore conluendo defendit, secl m vino decocta v-ehemen
tius prosunt.1 prefer my reading to Mayhoff s on two grounds.
(l) it is closer to the words of Dioscorides; (2 ) zelzemenlius is
more likely to have been added by Gargilius than omitted by a
scribe.

IN'l‘RODUC'l‘ION

For Book XX the chief MSS. are FdE, with help
from V from 3186, and from G (ἓὲ 162-186). For
XXI the MSS. are VGdRE to ἓ 161, where E has a
gap, and x begins. For XXII we have deR to ἓ 65,
VdRE to ἓ 71, VGdRE to ἓ 135, VdRE to ξ 144 and
VdE to the end. For XXIII we rely on V d and E.

For the Botanic 111 books and also for some other
parts of Pliny 111( textual critic is helped by Dios-
eorides and wllicoplnistus, but most of all by the
NIedicina of Gargilius Martialis, published, with a
book of prescriptione, attributed to Plinius Iunior
(Secundus), by V alentin Rose in 1875. Both are
taken largely from the Natural History, or perhaps
from its original sources, thus affording evidence
that is independent of our MSS. Unfortunately, the
prescriptions are not verbal quotations, but para-
phrases or summaries, given without naming the
sources. Rose’s edition was the first to be published,
and Detlefsen could make no use ofit ; Maylloff tends
10 attach too much importance 10 both Plinius
Iunior and Gargilius. The first sentence of the
former is worth quoting, both because it explains
why laymen in antiquity were seriously interested
in medicine, and also because it presents some
curious parallels to modern patent medicines.
“ Frequenter mihi in peregrinationibus accidit ut
aut propter meam aut propter meorum infirmitatem
varias fraudes medicorum experiscerer,⁰ quibusdam
vilissima remedia ingentibus pretiis vendentibus,
aliis ea quae curare nesciebant cupiditatis causa
suscipientibus.’'

The value of such excerptors from Pliny for the
reconstruction of the text is stressed by D. J. Camp-

a Sic, with a vl. experirer.

it turns white. Every day however before sunset
it should be put back under cover, since night dews
are harmful to marsh plants after they have been
cut down.

LXIX. Mago gives like instructions about the
rush also that. they call mai-iseum for weaving mats
he recommends that it too be gathered in ,June and
up to the middle ofJuly, giving the same instructions
for drying it which Ι have mentioned in their proper
place when dealing with sedge.‘¹ He distinguishes
another kind of rush, which Ι find is called the
marine rush and by the Greeks oxyschoenos. There
are three kinds of it: the pointed, barren rusb,
which the Greeks call the male, or oxys, while the
other two are female, and bear a black seed. One
of these, called by the Greeks melancranis, is thicker
and more bushy than the first3 the third, called
holoschoenus, being even more so. Of these melan-
cranis is found apart from other kinds of rush, but
oxys and holoschoenus grow on the same turf. The
most useful for wicker-work is holoschoenus, because
it is pliant and fleshy; it bears a fruit like eggs
sticking to one another. The rush we have called
male is sels-reproduced, the head being bent down
into the earth, but melancranis is reproduced from
its seed. Except for this, the roots of every kind
of rush die every year. Rushes are used for fish-
baskets, for the finer sort of wicker-work, and for the
wicks of lamps‚ the pith being especially useful3
and they grow to such a size near the maritime
Alps that when the hollow is cut open they measure
almost an inch across, while in Egypt some are as
narrow as the holes in a sieve,¹’ and of a length not

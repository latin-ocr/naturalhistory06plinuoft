XX. In the past there was a strong preference for ηε parion,
the wine of Surrentum, followed by one for Alban ssgi'jl‘ff ⁰s
or Falernian3 after that various choices have been
popular, each man—so unreasonable are we in our
judgments——dictating to everybody else a preference
for what he himself finds most pleasant; and yet

mankind could make use of these kinds of wine.
Today indeed not even our nobility ever enjoys
wines that are genuine. So low has our commercial

today, the freer it is from impurities. Neverthe-
less, the opinions of the wines we have mentioned
seem on the whole the best maintained. If anyone
lays stress also on the test of age, that Falernian is

less and tend to overload the stomach, but the wines
of Surrentum have no such bad effectis, nor do
they go to the head, while they check catarrhs of the

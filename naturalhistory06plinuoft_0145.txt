LXXV. The sacopenium which grows in our Sacopenium-

country is quite nnlike that which comes from
ov else as. The latter, also called swgapemon, re-
senibles ammoniae gum. It is good for pains in the
sides and in the chest, for convulsions, for chronic
conghs and expectoration‚ and for swellings of the
hypochondria. It cures also vertigo, palsy‚ opistho-

violent chills. It is given in vinegar to be smelt in
cases of suffocation of the womb. In other cases it
is both given in drink and with oil used as an em-

head itself. Both this juice and that of any other
plant is' gathered in wool, oris there be but little, by
scratching it off, as it is from lettuce, with the thumb

BOOK XXII. mn. 114-Lv. 116

well-known case of Pollio Romilius. He was more
than a century old when Augustus, now in Heaven,
who was his host? asked him what was the chief
means whereby he had kept such vigour of mind
and body. His reply was: “By honey wine
within and by oil without.” Varro relates that the
rainbowb disease (jaundice) has been styled the
royal disease because it is treated with the royal ⁰
drink of honey wine.

LIV. How melitites used to be made out of must iterium.
and honey I have set out in my account of wine.d I
believe that this kind of honey has not been made now
for generations, so liable was it to cause flatulence.
When well matured,e however, it used to be given
in sever because of its action on the bowels, and
also to sufferers from gout and from feebleness of the
sinews, and to women who are teetotalers.

LV. Honey is by nature closely related to wax, Waae.
the source of which, its virtues, and the districts
that produce it, I have discussed in the proper
places] All wax however is emollient, war-ming,
and restorative of flesh39 the fresher it is the
better. It is given to sufferers from dysentery in
their gruel, and the whole comb in a porridge of
groats that has been previously roasted. Wax and
milk are of opposite natures, and ten pilis of wax, of
the size of a grain of millet will, if swallowed, prevent
milk curdling in the stomach. Should the groin
swell, the application of white wax to the pubes is
a remedy.

⁹ Dioscorides (ΙΙ. 83) has πληρωτικήν τε (sc. δύναμιν ἔχει πᾶς

κηρὸς) μετρίως. Brotier is probably right in explaining thus:
ulcera corporum carne replet.

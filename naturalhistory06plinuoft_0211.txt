the little knots bare themselves, these sterns in
March are steeped in the lees of dark wine or Greek

which eomes up wild in sunny poor soils, springs
up with a broader fleshy leaf, coming sti ‘u ‹rht from
the root. ⁶ Itis the only one to be distinguished from
the others by a Greek name, being called ion, from
which ianthine eloth gets its name. Of the culti-
vated violets, the most highly esteemed is the yellow
variety. The kinds called Tusculan and marine
have a slightly broader but less perfumed petal.d
The Calatian variety however is entirely without
perfume and has a very small petal ;‘ll it is a gift of
autumn, but all other kinds bloom in spring.

be right, as the leaves have no smell.

² Some say the marsh marigold. Perhaps some variety of

pansy.

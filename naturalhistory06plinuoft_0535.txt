BOOK XXIII. vam. 133-Lxx. 135

LXVIII. As for wild plums, their fruit or the skin Wizol plams.
of their root, boiled down in dry wine from one
hemina to one third, checks looseness of the bowels
and colic. A cyathus of the decoction at a time
makes a sufficient dose.

LXIX. Both on wild and on cultivated plum trees
there forms a gummy substance called lichen by the
Greeks and wonderfully beneficia] for chaps and
condylomata.

LXX. In Egypt and in Cyprus are mulberries of a *numerasset*
unique sort. as I have already saida If the outer {gis-then
rind be peeled off they stream with copious juice3 a
deeper cut (so wonderful is their nature) finds them
dry.'³ The juice counteracts the poison of snakes, is
good for dysentery, disperses superficial abscesses
and all kinds of gatherings, heals wounds, and allays
headache and ear-ache. For diseases of the spleen
it is taken by the mouth and used as a liniment, as
also for violent chills. It very quickly breeds
worms, We Romans use the juice quite as much.
Taken in wine it neutralizes aconite and the poison
of spiders; it opens the bowels, expelling phlegm,
tapeworm and similar intestinal parasites. The
same effect also is produced by the pounded bark.
The leaves boiled in rain water together with the
bark of the dark fig and of the vine dye the hair.
The juice of the fruit itself moves the bowels
immediately3 the fruit itself is for the time being
good for the stomach, being coohng, though thirst-
producing, and if no other food is taken afterwards,
it swells up. The juice of unripe mulberries is
constipating3 there are marvels to be noticed about
this trec, mentioned by me in my description ⁶ of it,
which suggest that it has some sort of soul.

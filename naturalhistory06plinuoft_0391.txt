rusty iron, or a rotten rag was near when the mush-
room started to grow, it at once absorbs and turns into
poison all the moisture and flavour from this foreign
substance. Who can be trusted to have detected the
affected specimens except countryfolk and those who
actually gather them? Other infections even these
cannot detect3 for instance, if the hole of a serpent
has been near the mushroom, or should a serpent
have breathed on it as it first opened, its kinship
to poisons makes it capable of absorbing the venom.
So it would be well not to eat mushrooms until the
serpent has begun to hibernate. Indications of this
will be given by the many plants, trees, and shrubs,
that are always green from the time that the serpent
comes out from his hole to the time that he buries
himself in it; or even the ash tree will serve, whose
leaves do not grow after, nor fall before, the hiber-
nating pe1·iod.⁰ And ofmushrooms indeed the whole
life from beginning to end is not more than seven
da ‘s.

{LVIL The texture of fungi is rather flabby, and
there are several kinds of them, all derived only
from the gum that exudes from trees. The safest
have firm red flesh less pale than that of the mush-
room3 next comes the white kind, the stalk of which
is distinguished by its ending in 3 kind of flamen's
cap; a third kind, hog fungi, are very well adapted
for poisoning. Recently they have carried off whole
households and all the guests at banquets3 Annaeus
Serenus, for instance, Captain of Nero’s GuardS‚
with the tribunes and centurions. What great
pleasure can there be in such 3 risky food? Some
have classified fungi according to the kind of tree on
which they grow, one class including those growing on

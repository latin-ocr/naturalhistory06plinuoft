are two kin<ls3 the one with leaves like those of the
chickling-pea, the other with prickly leaves. The
latter blossoms later, and tends to be common in
the enclosures round country houses. Its seed is
rounder, black‚ and in a pod; that of the other is
like sanda Of prickly plants there is yet another
kind—rest-harrow. For it has prickles on the
branches, to which are attached leaves like those of
rue, the whole stem being covered with leaves so
that it looks like a chaplet. It springs up on newly
ploughed lands, is harmful to the crops and
extremely long-lived.

LIX. The stems of some prickly plants trail ns

along the ground, those for example of the plant
called coronopus. On the other hand anchusa
(alkanet), the root of which is used for dyeing
wood and wax, stands upright, as do, of the culti*
vated ὸ kinds, anthemis, phyllanthes, anemone and
aphace. Crepis and lotus have a foliated stem.

LX. The leaves of these plants differ as do the
leaves of trees : in shortness or length of stalk‚ in the
narrowness of the leaf itself, in its size, and further
in the corners, and indentations3 smell and blossom
differ also. The blossom lasts longer on some of them,
which flower one part at a time, on ocimum for
example, and on heliotropium, aphace and onochilis.
Many of these plants, like certain trees, have leaves
that never die, the chief being heliotropium,
adiantum, hulwort.

LXI. Eared plants are yet another kind, to which
belong achynops‚ alopecuros, stelephuros—by some
called ortyx, by others plantago, about which I shall
speak more fully in the section on medicina] plants ⁶
—and thryallis. Of these alopecurus has a soft ear

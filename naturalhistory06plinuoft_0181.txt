It is also made from fresh seed and from incisions

XCVI. There is in this class of plant a wild
variety called hippomarathum, by some myrsineum,
with larger leaves and a sharper taste, taller‚ as
thick as a walking-stick‚ and with a white root. It
grows in warm and rocky soils. Diocles has spoken
of yet another kind of hippomarathum, with a long,
narrow leaf, and a seed like that of coriander. The
cultivated kind is used in medicine for the wounds
of scorpions and serpents, the seed being taken in
wine. The juice is also dropped into the ears, where
it kills the worms infesting them. The plant itself
is an ingredient of nearly all condiments, being
especially suited for digestives. Moreover, it is
placed under the crusts of loaves.a The seed braces
a relaxed stomach, even if taken in severs, relieves
nausea if pounded and taken in water, and is a
highly praised remedy for complaints of the lungs
and liver. It stays looseness of the bowels, if a
moderate amount be taken3 when taken for griping
it is diuretic, and a decoction drunk when milk fails
fills the breasts again. The root cleanses the
kidneys when taken with barley water, or if the
juice of the boiled-down root be drunk with wine.
Taken in wine the root is also good for dropsy, like-
wise for spasms. The leaves are applied in vinegar
to inflamed ὁ tumours, and they expel stones in the
bladder. In whatever way it is taken it creates an
abundance of seed, being very soothing to the
privates, whether the root be boiled down with wine
for a fomentation, or the plant be pounded up and

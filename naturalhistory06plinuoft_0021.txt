INTRODUCTION

a cure. By the time of Pliny, however, the use oi
drugs was much more in favour with professional
physicians, and very common indeed among the
amateur doetors who treated themselves and their
families when they fell sick. Sometimes modern
medicine approves of the prescriptions given in the
Natural Hfflory, but for the most part they are of
little or no value, and occasionally even dangerous.
Amulets and other chamus, often mentioned, were
evidently popular, but Pliny himself seems on the
whole to be non-committal as to their efficacy,
although he condemns magio in the first Chapters of
Book XXX.

This faith in drugs and charnis may be, at least
in part, due to the probable increased prevalenee of
malai-ia in the first century ΑᾸ). Ancient medicine
was powerless against it, and its victims betook
themselves to drugs, at the same time developing a
timid inferiority complex with regard to the pre-
disposing causes—chin, exposure and fatigue. Among
the Moralz'a of Plutarch is an essay on keeping well
(de sanitate tuenda praecepta). It consists chiefly of
rules for avoiding “ sever '’ by abstaining from
excess or strain of all kinds. In fact it seems as
though the old Greek cult of physical fitness and
beauty-—for there was a science of health as well as
of healing—had been replaced by something very
near to valetudinarianism.

There is at least one ingredient of the Plinian
remedies that must have been of great value. Honey
appears again and again in both potions and external
applications‚ full use being made of its healing
powers. The superseding of honey by sugar has
been by no means an unmixed blessing.

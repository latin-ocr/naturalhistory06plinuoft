BOOK XXI. XLIII. 73—xL1v. 76

hives are full, and then they are taken back and the
honey is extracted. In Spain too for a like reason
they carry the hives about on mules. (XLIV.) The
food of bees is of so much importance that even their
honey may become poisonous. At Heraclia in
Pontus the honey turns out in certain years very
deadly‚ and that from the same beeS. As the
authorities have not said from what flowers this
honey' is extracted, I will myself put on recoid what
I have asce1 talned There is a plant which, from its
deadly effect ev en on cattle, more particularly upon
goats, is called aegolethron.‘¹ From the blossom
of this, when it withers in a rainy spring, bees
take in a noxious poison. Thus it happens that it
is not in all years that the danger is encountered.
The signs of poisonous honey are that it does not
thicken at all, its colour inclines to red, its smell is
strange and at once causes sneezing, and it is heavier
than harmless honey. Cattle which have eaten it
throw themselves on the ground, seeking to cool
themselves, for they actually drip with sweat.
Remedies are many, and I will give them in their
proper placefl But some should be given at once,
as the danger is so insidious: there is old honey
wine, made from the finest honey, with rue, and also
salted fish, these to be repeated several times should
the stomach reject them. It is an established fact
that this poison, through the excreta, affects even
dogs, which suffer similar toi-ture. It is a fact,
however, that honey wine made with poisonous
honey is, after maturing, quite hammes& and that
'there is nothing better than this honey, mixed with
costum, for improving the skin of women, or, mixed
with aloes, for the treatment of bruises.

INTRODUCTION

they require. But some inconsistencies and uncer
tainties are inevitable.

The resemblance of certain passages in the Materia
Medica of Dioscorides to parts of the botanical books
of Pliny—even to some parts outside these books—is
so stiiking that there must be a close relation between
them. Scholars without hesitation use the Gieek
text when passing judgment on the readings or
emendations of the manuscripts of Pliny. Many
times it is clear that Pliny either saw (or heard read)
Greek identical, or almost so, with our Dioscorides
but blundered badly in translating= his authority.
Among the cases of such blundering· mentioned in
the footnotes to this volume there is a striking
example in XXIII. ξ 7, where Pliny has cicatricibus
marcidis, ossibus purulente limosis, but the text of
Dioscorides reads (V. 53: πρὸς . . . οὖλα πλαδαρά,
ὦτα πυορροοῦντα. Hele are confused ούλα (gums)
and οὐλή (sear), and (unless with some editors we
read auribus for the ossibus of the manuscripts)
ὦτα and ὀστᾶ.

Now Pliny does not include Dioscorides among·
his authorities. Is this an accidental omission?
Pliny’s pride in acknowledging the sources from
which he derived his information makes this an
almost impossible explanation of the relationship
between the two authors. It is even more unlikely
that Dioscorides copied Pliny3 the discmpancies,
for one thing, are obviously the result of a mis-
understanding of Greek, not of Latin.

There remains a third possibility. Both authors
may have a common source, from which each made
large borrowings. It is thought that this common
source may have been Crateuas, of the first century
